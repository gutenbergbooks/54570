<span class="i0">"The sea, the sea, the open sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The blue, the fresh, the ever free,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>chanted the fresh and delicious voice of a young girl walking
along the sands of the seashore in the summer sunshine at Cape
May.</p>

<p>"Cross my palm with silver, and I'll tell your fortune, bonnie
maid," said a cracked, discordant voice.</p>

<p>The singer paused abruptly, and looked at the owner of the
voice&mdash;a lean, decrepit old hag, who extended her withered hand
imploringly.</p>

<p>"Nay, now, good soul," answered she, with a merry laugh,
"fortune will come to me anyway, even if I keep my silver
piece."</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;aye, it will," said the old crone, wagging her head like
a bird of evil omen; "it aye comes to faces as bonny as your own.
But it's I that can tell you whether it be good or ill fortune."</p>

<p>"Here, then," said the girl, still laughing, and putting a silver
piece into the trembling old hand; "be cheerful, now, and tell me
a brave fortune for my money."</p>

<p>The old sibyl did not appear to relish the light and jesting tone
of the other, and stood for a moment gazing at her in grave and
portentous silence.</p>

<p>What a contrast the two presented as they stood looking at each
other!</p>

<p>The girl was beautiful, with all the delicate freshness and slimness
of eighteen. She was a dazzling blonde, with sea-blue eyes,
and hair like spun gold falling beneath her jaunty sailor hat in
long, loose curls to her graceful waist. She was fair as a lily,
with a flush like the heart of a sea-shell on her round, dimpled
cheeks. Her brow was fair and broad, and fringed with soft,
childish rings of sunny hair. Her nose was small and straight;
her mouth was curved like Cupid's bow, its short, exquisite upper
lip lending a touch of archness to the patrician mold of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
features. The small, delicately shaped hands and feet were in
keeping with the rare beauty of her face and form. She was
simply clad in a jaunty sailor costume of dark blue serge
trimmed with white braid and pearl buttons, and carried a volume
of poems in her gloved hand.</p>

<p>As contrasted with this peerless beauty and youthful grace the
old sibyl appeared hideous as a fiend beside an angel.</p>

<p>She was diminutive in stature, and bent nearly double with
the weight of years. Her scanty, streaming white hair was in
odd contrast with the dark, parchment-like skin and jet-black
eyes that sparkled with a keen and unnatural brightness. A
wicked, malevolent expression was the prevailing cast of her
wrinkled features, and her cheeks and lips having fallen in upon
her toothless gums, converted her grim smile into a most
Satanic grin. The dreadful old beldam was attired in a <i>melange</i>
of ancient and faded finery, consisting of a frayed and dirty
quilted satin petticoat and an overdress of rich brocade, whose
original brilliant oriental hues were almost obliterated by
time and ill-usage. She gathered these faded relics about her
with a certain air of pride as she said to the young girl:</p>

<p>"Sit ye down upon the stone there, and let me look at your
palm."</p>

<p>She was obeyed with a demure smile by the listener, who drew
off her glove and presented the loveliest hand in the world for
inspection&mdash;a lily-white hand, small, and dimpled, and tapering,
with rosy palm and tips&mdash;a perfect hand that might have been
enclosed in a glass case and looked at only as a "thing of
beauty."</p>

<p>The sibyl took that dainty bit of flesh and blood into her brown,
wrinkled claws, and scanned it intently.</p>

<p>"You are well-born," she said, slowly.</p>

<p>"You can tell that much by the shape of my nose, I suppose,"
laughed the girl, mischievously.</p>

<p>The old hag glanced at the elegant, aristocratic little member
in question and frowned.</p>

<p>"I can tell by your hand," said she, shortly: "Not but that it
is written on your features also&mdash;for you are very beautiful."</p>

<p>"Others have told me so before," said the girl, with her musical,
light-hearted laugh.</p>

<p>"Peace, will-'o-the-wisp!" said the old woman, sternly. "Do
not pride yourself upon that fatal gift! You are lovely as an
angel, but your beauty will be your <i>bane</i>."</p>

<p>"But beauty wins <i>love</i>," cried the listener, artlessly, while a
rosy blush stained her fair brow and cheeks.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, it wins love," was the crusty answer. "Your life
will have enough of love, be sure. But beauty wins <i>hate</i>, too.
The love that is lavished on you will be shadowed and darkened
by the hate your fair face will inspire. Do not think you will
be happy because you are beautiful. Years of wretchedness lie
before you!"</p>

<p>"Oh! no," said the girl, with an involuntary shiver.</p>

<p>"It is true," said the sibyl, peering into the hand that she held.
"If you could read this little pink palm as I do, you would go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
wild with the horror of it. The line of life is crossed with sorrows.
Sorrow and shame lie darkly over your future."</p>

<p>"Not <i>shame</i>," said the young girl, cresting her small head with
a queenly gesture of pride. "Sorrow, perhaps; but never
<i>shame</i>!"</p>

<p>"It is written," answered the old woman, sharply. "Do you
think to alter the decrees of fate with your idle words, proud
girl? No, no; there will be a stain on the whiteness of your life
that your tears can never wash out. Love and hate will brand it
there. You will be a young man's bride, but an old man's darling."</p>

<p>She paused, and a faint smile dimpled the young girl's cheek.
Apparently the latter prediction did not seem to overwhelm her
as the witch expected.</p>

<p>"I have been an old man's darling all my life," she said gently.
"I assure you it is very pleasant."</p>

<p>"Girl, I meant not the tie of consanguinity," cried the sibyl,
sharply. "You do not understand. Ah! you will know soon
enough; for I tell you, girl, a cloud is gathering over your head;
gathering swiftly to burst over you in a tempest of fury. Fly!
Fly! Go and cast yourself into those raging Atlantic waves
yonder, rather than breast the torrent of sorrow about to break
upon your life!"</p>

<p>Her voice had risen almost to a pitch of fury with the last
words, and her eyes flashed as with the light of inspiration. She
cast a strange look upon the trembling girl, and, dropping her
hand abruptly, turned away, hobbling out of sight with a rapidity
that scarcely seemed possible in one so stricken with age.</p>

<p>The young girl, who a moment ago had seemed so blithe and
<i>debonair</i>, sat still a few moments where the sibyl had left her,
looking curiously into the pink palm from which such dire prophecies
had been read. She looked like one dazed, and a slight
pallor had momentarily usurped the rose tint on her cheek.</p>

<p>"How earnestly the old creature talked," she murmured, musingly,
"as if that horrid jargon of hers could be true. What is
there in my hand but a few lines that mean nothing? She saw
that I did not believe in her art, and predicted those dreadful
things merely to punish me for my doubt. Heigho! I have never
had a sorrow in my life and never expect to have one."</p>

<p>She drew on her glove, and taking up her volume of poems,
pursued her way along the shore, looking a little more thoughtful
than when she had tripped that way a little while before
singing in the lightness of her heart.</p>

<p>After walking a short distance she paused, and selecting a shady
seat, sat down where she could watch the blue waves of the ocean
rolling in, crested with snowy foam, and the wild flight of the
sea-birds wheeling in the sunny air, and darting down now and
then for some object of prey their keen eyes discerned in the
water. After watching these objects for awhile she grew weary,
and, opening her book, began to read fitfully, turning the pages
at random, as if only half her heart was in the task.</p>

<p>She had been reading perhaps half an hour when the light dip
of oars in the water saluted her ears. She looked up quickly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
saw a fairy little skiff with one occupant coming around a curve
of the shore toward her. The skiff was very dainty, with trimly
cushioned seats. It was painted in shining blue and white, and
bore around about the prow in letters of blue and gold, the fanciful
name, "Bonnibel." The single occupant, a young man singularly
handsome and resolute-looking, called out as he neared
the shore:</p>

<p>"I have borrowed your skiff very unceremoniously, Miss Vere;
but since I have been detected in the theft, may I not persuade
you to leave your lonely eyrie there, and accompany me in my
little pleasure-trip this evening?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>Bonnibel Vere closed her book and sprang up with a blush
and smile of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Of course you know that I cannot refuse the invitation," said
she, brightly. "I am just dying to talk to some one."</p>

<p>"Woman-like!" answered Leslie Dane, laughing, as he assisted
her to a seat.</p>

<p>"I suppose you never find your high majesty in a like predicament,"
said she, rather pettishly, as the skiff swept out into the
blue, encircling waves.</p>

<p>He smiled at the childish air of offended dignity she assumed.</p>

<p>"<i>Au contraire</i>," he answered, gaily, "it was only this evening
that I was experiencing a like feeling. For instance, when I
captured your skiff and set forth alone I was just dying to have
you along with me to talk to. And now I have my wish and
you have yours. We are very fortunate!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" she inquired, carelessly. "If gratified
wishes make one fortunate, then I have been fortunate all my
life. Uncle Francis has never refused to indulge me in anything
I ever set my heart upon."</p>

<p>"He has been very kind, then, and you ought to be a very
happy girl," he answered; "yet you were looking rather grave
and thoughtful this evening as I came around the curve. Was
your book so very interesting?"</p>

<p>"It failed to awaken an interest in me," she answered, simply,
"for I was thinking of other things."</p>

<p>"Of weighty and momentous matters, no doubt," he commented.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," she answered. "Come now, Mr. Dane, guess
what I have been doing this evening."</p>

<p>"It would be a hard task to follow the movements of so erratic a
star as Miss Bonnibel Vere," he said in a light tone of railery, yet
looking at her with all his manly heart in his large, dreamy, dark
eyes. "Do not keep me in suspense, fair lady, this sultry evening.
Confess."</p>

<p>She looked up, and, meeting his ardent glance, dropped her
eyes until the long, curling lashes hid them from view. A scarlet
banner fluttered into her cheeks like a danger signal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been getting my fortune told&mdash;there!" said she, laughing.</p>

<p>"Whew!" said Mr. Dane in profound surprise. "Getting your
fortune told! And by whom, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Oh, by a horrid old crone who stepped into my path on my
way here and demanded a piece of silver and wished to foretell
my future. Of course, I do not believe in such things at all, but
I humored the poor old soul just for fun, you know, and a dreadful
prediction she gave me for my money."</p>

<p>"Let me hear it," said Leslie Dane, smiling.</p>

<p>Bonnibel recounted the words and gestures of the old sibyl
with patient exactness and inimitable mimicry to her interested
listener.</p>

<p>"It was Wild Madge, no doubt," said he, when she had finished.
"I have seen her several times on the shore, and I made
quite an effective picture of her once, though I dare say the old
witch would want to murder me if she knew it. The gossips
hereabouts assert that she can read the future very truly."</p>

<p>"You do not believe it&mdash;do you?" asked she, looking up with
a gleam of something like dread in her beautiful blue orbs.</p>

<p>"Believe it&mdash;of course not," said he, contemptuously. "There
were but two things she told you that I place any faith in."</p>

<p>"What are they?" she questioned, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I believe you will be an old man's darling, for I know you
are that already. Your Uncle Francis loves the very ground
you walk upon, to use a homely expression, and, Bonnibel," he
paused, his voice lingering over the sound of her name with inexpressible
tenderness.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said, looking up with an innocent inquiry in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"And, Bonnibel&mdash;forgive my daring, little one&mdash;I believe you
will be a young man's bride if you will let me make you such."</p>

<p>They were spoken&mdash;words that had been trembling on his lips
all these summer months, in which Bonnibel Vere had grown
dearer to him than his own life&mdash;the words that would seal his
fate! He looked at her imploringly, but her face was turned
away, and she was trailing one white ungloved hand idly through
the blue water.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am presumptuous in speaking such words to you,
little one," he continued, gently. "I am but a poor artist, with
fame and fortune yet to win, and the world says that you will be
your uncle's heiress. Yet I have dared to love you, Bonnibel&mdash;who
could see you and not love you? Are you very angry with
me, darling?"</p>

<p>Still no answer from the silent girl before him. She kept her
sweet face turned away from his gaze, and continued to play
with the water as though indifferent to his words. He went on
patiently, his full, manly voice freighted with deep emotion:</p>

<p>"I am as proud as you in my way. Bonnibel, I do not ask
to claim you now in my struggle with the world. I only ask
you to remember me, and that when fame and fortune are both
conquered, I may return to lay them at your feet."</p>

<p>He paused and waited, thinking that she must be very angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
indeed to avert her face so resolutely; but suddenly, with a ripple
of silvery laughter, she turned and looked at him.</p>

<p>Oh! the beauty of that face she turned upon him! It was fairly
transfigured with love and happiness. It was bathed in brilliant
blushes, tinted like the sunset red that was flushing the evening
sky. A quivering smile played around her delicate lips, and two
vivid stars of light burned in the blue deeps of her eyes.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he cried, rapturously, "you are not angry; you
forgive me&mdash;you will let me worship you, and you will love me a
little in return?"</p>

<p>"You are very presumptuous, Mr. Dane," said she, trying to
frown away the smiles that danced around her lips.</p>

<p>"Do not play with me, Bonnibel," he said, earnestly. "You
are too young and innocent to play the coquette. Lay your little
hand in mine, dearest, and promise that one day, though it
may be years hence, you will be my wife."</p>

<p>He dropped the oars, and suffered the fairy bark to drift at its
own sweet will, while he reached his hand to hers. She hesitated
one moment between girlish shyness and a mischievous love of
teasing, but a swift look at the dark, eloquent face of her handsome
lover conquered her. She laid her beautiful hand in his
slender fingers, and murmured, in a tone of passionate tenderness:</p>

<p>"Leslie, the greatest happiness the world holds for me is to be
your wife!"</p>

<p>Leslie Dane's dark eyes grew radiant with joy and pride.</p>

<p>"My darling, my queen," he murmured. "A thousand
thanks for that assurance! How can I thank you enough for
giving me so much happiness?"</p>

<p>"You have made me very happy, too, Leslie," said the girl,
simply.</p>

<p>"But what will your uncle say to us, do you think, Bonnibel?"
said he, presently. "Will he not be angry with the portionless
artist who dares to sue for this fairy hand?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no," she said, innocently. "He has never denied me
anything in his life. He will consent when he knows how much
I love you. You must ask him this very evening to let us be engaged
while you are away winning fame and fortune. He will
not be angry."</p>

<p>"I hope not," said the less sanguine lover. "But the sun is
setting, darling. We must return."</p>

<p>In the beautiful summer evening they rowed back through the
blue waves, with the curlews calling above their heads, and the
radiant sunset shining on the water with a brightness that
seemed typical of the future which lay before their young and
loving hearts.</p>

<p>At length they anchored their boat, and stepped upon the
shore in full view of a large and handsome white villa that stood
in the middle of beautiful and well-kept grounds. Toward this
abode of wealth and pride they directed their footsteps.</p>

<p>"Uncle Francis is sitting out on the piazza," said Bonnibel, as
they went up the smooth, graveled walk. "You must go right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
in and ask him, Leslie, while I run away up-stairs to dress for
dinner."</p>

<p>"Very well, dear. And&mdash;stay, darling, if I should not be here
when you come back, run down to the shore after the moon is
up, and I will tell you what answer your uncle gives my suit."</p>

<p>"Very well; I will do so," she answered. "But I am sure that
Uncle Francis will keep you to dinner, so I shall see you directly
I come down."</p>

<p>He pressed her hand and she tripped across the piazza into
the hall, and then ran up the broad stair-way to her room with
a lighter heart than ever beat in her breast again.</p>

<p>Leslie Dane walked down the piazza to where Bonnibel's uncle
and guardian, Francis Arnold, the millionaire, sat in his easy-chair
puffing his evening cigar, and indolently watching the
blue wreaths of smoke curling over his head.</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold was a spare, well-made man of sixty-five, with
iron-gray hair and beard. His well-cut features were sharp and
resolute in contour, and betokened more sternness than Bonnibel
Vere ever dreamed of in his unfailing tenderness to herself. He
was elegantly dressed, and wore a costly diamond ring on his
little finger.</p>

<p>As the young man drew near, the stately millionaire arose and
acknowledged his respectful greeting with considerable cordiality.</p>

<p>"Ah! Dane, good-evening. Have a seat and join me in a
cigar."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I do not smoke," answered the young artist,
politely, "but I am sorry to interrupt your enjoyment of that
luxury."</p>

<p>"It does not matter," said the millionaire, tossing his own
cigar away and resuming his seat. "Sit down, Dane. Well,
how do you get on with your pictures?"</p>

<p>The dusky, handsome face lighted up with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Famously, thank you. I have sold two little pictures in New
York lately at quite a fair valuation, and the critics have praised
them. They say I have genius and should study under the best
masters."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I congratulate you," said Mr. Arnold, cordially.
"Do you think of taking their advice?"</p>

<p>"I do. I shall sail for Rome very soon now, and study there
a year or two," said Leslie, his features beaming with pleasure.
"I believe I shall succeed in my ambition. I feel within myself
the promptings of genius, and I know that my persistent labor
will conquer fame and fortune."</p>

<p>The elder man regarded him with some surprise. He had never
seen him so enthusiastic on any subject before, even that of his
beloved art.</p>

<p>"You seem very sanguine and determined," he observed with
a smile.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> determined," answered Leslie, gravely. "I mean to
<i>conquer</i> success. You remember the hackneyed quotation:</p>

<span class="i0">"'In the proud lexicon of youth which fate reserves to a bright manhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There is no such a word as Fail!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I did not know you had such a towering ambition, Dane,"
said the millionaire, with a smile.</p>

<p>"My ambition is no higher than my hopes, Mr. Arnold, for I
have come here this evening to ask you for the hand of Miss
Vere when I shall be in a position worthy of that high honor!"</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>The word rolled out of the millionaire's mouth like a thunder-clap.</p>

<p>He straightened himself in his chair, seeming to grow several
inches taller, and his iron-gray hair seemed to stand erect on his
head with indignant surprise. His keen gray eyes regarded Leslie
Dane with a stony stare of surprise, bordering on contempt.</p>

<p>"I have the sanction of your niece, Miss Vere, to ask of you her
hand in marriage," repeated Leslie Dane, calmly.</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold sprang to his feet, furious with rage, pale as death
under the influence of this overmastering emotion.</p>

<p>"Villain!" he cried out in loud, excited tones. "Do you mean
to tell me that you have abused the confidence I reposed in
your honor as a gentleman, to win the heart of that innocent,
trusting child? You, a poor, penniless, unknown artist!"</p>

<p>"I grant you I am poor, Mr. Arnold," answered Leslie Dane,
rising and confronting his accuser with a mien as proud as his
own. "But that I have abused your confidence, I deny! Bonnibel
loves me as I love her, but I have taken no undue advantage
to gain her love. You invited me here, and gave me every opportunity
to cultivate her acquaintance. Can you wonder that I
learned to love one so sweet and beautiful?"</p>

<p>"I wonder at your presumption in telling her so!" flashed the
angry guardian. "If you loved her you should have worshiped
her from afar as a star too far away to warm you with its beams.
By Jove! sir, do you know that Bonnibel Vere will be my heiress?
Do you know that the best blood of the land flows in her veins?
Do you know that her father was General Harry Vere, who fell
bravely in battle, and left a record as proud as any in the land?"</p>

<p>"General Vere's fame is not unknown to me, sir," answered
Leslie, calmly. "I give him due honor as a hero. But, sir,
my blood is as blue as Bonnibel's own! I belong to the noblest
and best family of the South. True, we lost all our wealth by
the late war, but we belong to the first rank yet in point of birth.
I can give you perfect satisfaction on these points, sir. And for
the rest, I do not propose to claim Bonnibel until I have realized
a fortune equal to her own, and added fresh laurels to the name
that is already crowned with bays in the far South, from whence
I come. My father was an officer in the army, too, sir, and not
unknown to fame."</p>

<p>"We waste words," said the millionaire, shortly. "No matter
what your birth, you were presumptuous in addressing my niece,
knowing that your poverty must be an insuperable bar to your
union. Perhaps it was her wealth you were after. The idea of
making love to that child! She <i>is</i> but a child, after all, and does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
know her own mind. A simple, trusting child, ready to fall a
prey to the first good-looking fortune-hunter that comes along."</p>

<p>"Were it not for your gray hairs, Mr. Arnold, I should not permit
you to apply such an insulting epithet to me!" flashed out
Leslie Dane in a white heat of passion.</p>

<p>"You provoked it, sir," cried the old man, wrathfully; "<i>you</i>
to try to win my little ewe-lamb from me. She, that her
dying mother, my only sister, gave to my arms in her infancy as
a precious trust. Do you think I would give her to you, or to
any man who did not stand head and shoulders above his fellow-men
in every point of excellence? Would I waste her sweet
years waiting for you to grow worthy of her? No, no, Leslie
Dane, you can never have my darling! She shall never give you
another thought. Go, sir, and never darken my doors with your
unworthy presence again!"</p>

<p>He pointed to the door, and the young artist had no choice but
to obey. He was trembling with passion, and his dark eyes blazed
with a light not pleasant to see.</p>

<p>"I obey you, sir," he said, proudly. "I go, but remember I do
not give up my claim on Bonnibel! Sooner or later she shall yet
be my wife! And, mark me, sir, you have done a bitter work to-day
that you shall one day repent with all your soul."</p>

<p>With the words he was gone, his tall, proud figure striding
down the graveled walk, and disappearing in the twilight
shadows.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>Mr. Arnold and his family, consisting only of his wife and
step-daughter, Felise Herbert, were in their places at the table
before Bonnibel came floating in, a vision of rosy, innocent loveliness.</p>

<p>If she had been beautiful before in her plain blue walking-dress
she was doubly so now in her soft white robe of India muslin,
with fleecy trimmings of rich Valenciennes lace. A pale blue
sash was knotted about her slender waist, and clusters of fragrant
blue violets looped back her long golden curls. A golden chain
and a cross studded with pearls was clasped about her white neck,
though she scarcely needed such adornment. Her beauty was a
crown in itself.</p>

<p>She came in a little shyly, and blushing very much, for she expected
to see her lover, and she glanced under her long lashes
along the length of the table as she took her place, expecting to
meet his adoring gaze.</p>

<p>He was not there.</p>

<p>The young girl scarcely knew what to think. She glanced at
her uncle as if to enlighten herself.</p>

<p>He was not looking at her; indeed, he seemed to avoid her
glance purposely, and a moody frown was fixed upon his brow.
Her aunt vouchsafed her a cold, unmeaning stare, and Felise
Herbert's large black eyes dilated as she looked at Bonnibel as if
with gratified malice.</p>

<p>These two ladies, mother and daughter, deserve more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
passing mention at our hands. We will briefly describe them.
Mrs. Arnold was a fine-looking brunette of about forty-five,
and would have been rather handsome but for a settled expression
of peevishness and discontent that rested upon her features. She
was elaborately dressed in a soft summer silk of silver-gray trimmed
in black lace, and wore very rich cameo jewelry.</p>

<p>Miss Herbert was a younger and handsomer copy of her
mother. She was tall and well-formed, with quite regular features,
large black eyes, and silky braids of black hair. She was
about twenty-five years old, and was becomingly dressed in a
thin black grenadine, richly trimmed with satin of the color of
old gold. Her ornaments were necklace, earrings, and bracelets
of gold. Mr. Arnold could not complain of the beauty of his
household, though his tastes in that particular were extremely refined.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he said, when the dinner which had been discussed
in most unusual silence was over, "come with me into
the library. I have something to say to you."</p>

<p>Bonnibel linked her arm fondly in his and they passed out together.</p>

<p>Miss Herbert looked at her mother, and a glance of great significance
passed between them, the expression of discontent on
the elder lady's features now deepening to positive anger and
hatred.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, as if answering her daughter's look; "go and
hear what he has to say to the little witch!"</p>

<p>Miss Herbert arose and passed out of the room with soft,
subdued footfalls.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold paced the floor restlessly, clenching her white
hands angrily.</p>

<p>"My clever, beautiful Felise," she murmured. "How my
husband slights, and ignores her to lavish his whole affection
upon that little hateful, yellow-haired child! After all my
scheming to get him to love Felise, and at least divide his
fortune between them, he boldly declared this evening to that
young artist-fool that he would make Bonnibel his heiress. And
Felise&mdash;she will have nothing but what I can give her out of my
portion! which he will make as small as possible in order to enrich
his idol. It is too bad&mdash;too bad! Something must be done
to induce him to change his mind. I wish she would elope
with Leslie Dane. That would alienate my husband from her
forever."</p>

<p>The entrance of the servants to clear the table interrupted her.
She left the room, with its glitter of lights and glass, silver
and flowers, and hurried away to her own luxurious apartments
to nurse her wrath and jealousy in solitude.</p>

<p>She hated Bonnibel Vere, and she hated her husband. He had
married her twenty years ago, when she had palmed herself off
upon him as a widow of high family and small means, while in
reality she was a vulgar and penniless adventuress, having but
one pure affection in her heart, and that her blind, idolatrous
love for her spoiled and wayward little daughter.</p>

<p>Francis Arnold had discovered the cheat practiced on him long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
ago, and though too proud to proclaim the secret to the world,
the love he had felt for his handsome wife had changed into
quiet contempt that stung her more than the loudest upbraidings.</p>

<p>Her daughter, who was treacherous as a cat and vindictive as
a snake, he simply hated, and no blandishments or persuasions
could induce him to settle anything upon her, though the one object
of the mother's heart was to secure his whole fortune for
herself and Felise.</p>

<p>We will pause in our contemplation of the ambitious woman's
rage and follow Bonnibel and her uncle to the large, well-lighted,
and elegant library.</p>

<p>"Uncle," said the girl, going up to him as he sank into his
easy-chair, and laying her hand caressingly on his cheek, "are
you not well? You seem so strange, you do not smile on your
little girl as usual."</p>

<p>He was silent a moment as if struggling for words in which to
express his grievance, then he broke out impetuously:</p>

<p>"I am sick, little one, sick at heart. I have received a dreadful
blow this evening&mdash;one that fairly stunned me!"</p>

<p>"Dear uncle," said she, with innocent unconsciousness, "who
was it that dared to wound you so?"</p>

<p>"Bonnibel, it was Leslie Dane, the poor young artist whom I
have patronized this summer because I pitied him! Darling, he
had the audacious impertinence to ask me for this little hand!"
he lifted it from his shoulder, where it rested fondly, and pressed
it to his lips.</p>

<p>But Bonnibel caught it away and started back from his side,
her cheeks growing white and her blue eyes dilating.</p>

<p>"What did you say to him?" she inquired, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I told him he was a worthless fortune-hunter, and I drove
him forth with scorn and contempt," said the millionaire hotly.</p>

<p>"You did&mdash;you did!" she cried, horror and incredulity struggling
in her voice and face. "You insulted him thus? Why,
Uncle Francis, I <i>love</i> him!"</p>

<p>In those concluding words there was at once a protest and a
defiance. It was as if she had felt and said that <i>her</i> love should
have been a sufficient shield and protection for him it clung
around so fondly.</p>

<p>"Pooh! nonsense!" said Arnold, trying a light tone of railery;
"you are but a child, Bonnibel, you do not know what love
means. Do you think I would suffer you to throw yourself
away on that worthless fellow?"</p>

<p>"He is not worthless," she cried out warmly. "He is noble,
good and true, and I love him dearly. But, Uncle Francis," she
said, suddenly changing her indignant tone to one of gentle entreaty,
"surely you are only jesting and teasing your little girl,
and I beg you not to use such dreadful language again, for you
insult the man whom I love with my whole heart, and whom I
shall one day marry."</p>

<p>"Never! never!" he shouted madly. "Girl, you have been
spoiled and indulged until you are silly enough to cry for the
moon and expect me to pluck it from heaven for you! But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
will save you from your folly this time. I will <i>never</i> permit you
to marry Leslie Dane!"</p>

<p>It was the first time he had ever denied her anything in the
course of her happy, care-free life. And now his cruel and resolute
refusal of this new toy she wanted so much, absolutely stunned
her and deprived her of speech.</p>

<p>She sank into a chair helplessly, and looked at him with parted,
tremulous lips, and with wild, astonished blue eyes. He saw
how shocked and incredulous she was, and altering his tone, began
to explain and argue with her:</p>

<p>"My darling, Leslie Dane is no match for my little girl. He is
poor and has nothing to recommend him but a handsome face,
and a little talent for daubing with paints and pencils, while you
are a beauty and an heiress, and can boast a proud descent. I
have made my will, and it is there in my desk this moment. In
it I have left you everything except one-third of my property,
which my widow will legally inherit. Surely my generosity merits
the one little return I ask of you. Simply that you will give
up Leslie Dane."</p>

<p>She looked up at him as he offered his costly bribe, and shook
her head gravely.</p>

<p>"You have been very kind to me always, uncle, I never knew
you could be cruel until now. I thank you for your kind intention,
but I will not give up Leslie for such a sordid bribe. Keep
your money, and I will keep my love!"</p>

<p>"I am not giving you the choice, girl," he answered, angrily.
"I intend you to have the money whether you want it or not,
and I have already said that you shall <i>never</i> marry Leslie Dane."</p>

<p>"And I say that I <i>will</i> marry him!" she cried, springing up in
a rage as passionate and unreasoning as his own, her blue eyes
blazing with defiance. "You shall not prevent me! I love him
better than any one else on earth, and I will marry him if I repent
it every hour of my after life."</p>

<p>So saying she rushed from the room, and pausing only to catch
up a dark shawl and wrap it about her, she sped down the graveled
walk on her way to seek her lover.</p>

<p>She paused outside the gate, and crouching down, peered anxiously
back to see if she was followed. The moon was up, shining
brilliantly over everything. She saw her uncle come out on
the piazza and drop into his favorite seat. Then the fragrance
of a cigar floated out on the warm August air. Bonnibel hurried
on down to the shore.</p>

<p>Leslie Dane was waiting for her, pacing the sands impatiently
in the soft moonlight.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>Bonnibel ran forward and threw herself on her lover's breast
in a passion of tears.</p>

<p>"You know all then, my darling?" holding her fast against his
wildly-throbbing heart.</p>

<p>She could not speak for the sobs that came heaving from her
aching little heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Bonnibel had never wept so wildly in all her life. It seemed to
her that she would die of her grief as she lay panting and weeping
in Leslie's tender arms.</p>

<p>"Do not weep so, my little love," he whispered. "We were
too sanguine of success. But try to bear it bravely, my Bonnibel.
We both are young. We can bear to wait a few years until my
success is assured, and then I will claim you for my own in
spite of all the world!"</p>

<p>Bonnibel did not answer. She continued to sob heart-brokenly,
and Leslie could feel her little heart beating wildly against
his breast as if it would burst with the strain of her grief.</p>

<p>So absorbed was he in trying to comfort the agitated girl that
he did not hear the sound of an approaching footstep.</p>

<p>The next moment Wild Madge, the sibyl, stood before them,
and the echo of her weird and mocking laugh blent strangely
with the hollow beat of the Atlantic waves.</p>

<p>"Aha," she cried discordantly. "You weep, my bonny maid!
Ah! said I not that the clouds of sorrow hung low over that golden
head?"</p>

<p>Bonnibel started and clung closer to her lover, while a tremor
shook her frame.</p>

<p>Leslie turned angrily and rebuked the old woman.</p>

<p>"Begone!" he said sternly. "How dare you come prowling
about this lady with your croakings of evil? Never dare to address
her again."</p>

<p>Wild Madge retreated a few steps and stood looking at him
malevolently in the moonlight. Again her laugh rang out mockingly.</p>

<p>"Never fear, fond lover, Wild Madge would not harm a hair
of that bonny head you shelter on your breast. But destiny is
stronger than you or I. Her doom is written. Take the little
maid in your arms and spring out into the sea there, and save
her from the heart-aches that are beginning now!"</p>

<p>"Begone, I say!" reiterated the young artist threateningly.</p>

<p>"I obey you," said the sibyl, retreating, with her mocking,
discordant laugh still ringing in their ears.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he whispered, "look up, my sweet one. The crazy
old creature is gone. You need not fear her predictions&mdash;they
mean nothing! Try and calm yourself and listen to me. I have
much to say to you to-night for it is the last time we shall meet
until I come to claim my bride. In a few hours I must leave
here. To-morrow I shall be on a steamer bound for Europe."</p>

<p>"So soon?" she gasped brokenly, stifling her anguished sobs.</p>

<p>"The sooner the better, darling. I must not dally here when
I have so much work to do. Remember I have fame and fortune
to conquer before we meet again!"</p>

<p>"It will be so long," she moaned, slipping out of his arms and
sinking down on the pebbly beach with her face hidden in her
hands.</p>

<p>Leslie picked up the shawl which had slipped from her shoulders
and wrapped it carefully about her, for the sea-air was
chilly and damp.</p>

<p>"It may seem long to us now, dear," he said, sitting down beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
her, "but in reality it will pass very quickly. I shall work
very hard with such a prize in view, and I hope the time of our
separation will not be long. I shall go at once to Rome and
place myself under the best masters. I have genius, for I feel it
within me, and the critics already admit it. Never fear, darling,
but that my success will be speedy and sure."</p>

<p>"But away off to Rome," said the girl. "Oh! Leslie, that
seems as if you were going out of the world. Why need you go
to Italy? Cannot you study here in this country?"</p>

<p>"Not so well, my little love, as in Italy, where I can have better
masters, and better facilities for studying the paintings of the
world's greatest artists in the beautiful old churches and cathedrals.
I must have the best instruction, for I want to make the
name you will bear an honored one."</p>

<p>She lifted her beautiful, tear-wet face in the moonlight, and
said, gently and simply:</p>

<p>"We need not wait for fame and fortune, Leslie. Take me
with you now."</p>

<p>For a minute Leslie Dane could not speak. She waited, <i>patiently</i>
for her, laying her hands in his, and looking up into his face
with eyes beautiful enough to lead a man's heart astray and bewilder
his reason.</p>

<p>"My child," he said, presently, "I wish that I might do so,
but you know not what you ask. You have been reared in the
lap of luxury and pride. You could not live through the deprivation
and poverty I must endure before I conquer success."</p>

<p>"I could bear anything better than the separation from you,
Leslie," said the poor child, who had but the faintest idea what
those two words, "poverty and privation," meant.</p>

<p>"You think so, dear," said the artist, "because you do not
know the meaning of poverty; but adversity would wither and
destroy you as quickly as some hot-house blossom would die
when transplanted to regions of ice and snow. No, darling, I am
too proud to take you now in my obscurity and poverty. Let us
wait until the name I can give you shall be an honor to wear."</p>

<p>"It must be so if you wish it, Leslie," she answered, sadly;
"but, oh, how can I bear the long separation when I love you so
devotedly?"</p>

<p>"It will not be for long, dearest&mdash;two or three years at best.
The time will pass quickly to you in your happy home, under the
devoted care of your Uncle Francis&mdash;only you must not permit
him to alienate your affections from me, for that I am sure is his
present intention."</p>

<p>She was silent, resting her head against his supporting arm,
and passing her small hand wearily over her brow as if to dispel
some gathering mist from her sight. The solemn, mystical
sound of the foam-capped waves breaking silently on the shore
seemed strangely pathetic to her ears. They had never sounded
so sad before.</p>

<p>"Darling, of what are you thinking?" he asked, gently.</p>

<p>She started and shivered, lifting her white face up to his with
a look that nearly broke his heart, it was so pitifully pathetic.
He had never seen anything but happiness on that beautiful face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Why had he won her love only to plant the thorns of sorrow in
that fond and trusting heart?</p>

<p>"Leslie, dear," she said, in a strangely altered voice, "do you
believe in presentiments?"</p>

<p>He started at the words.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he answered, "I hardly know whether I do or
not. It would be very superstitious to believe in such things,
would it not? And yet may not a merciful Providence sometimes
vouchsafe us warnings of things, as the Scotch say, 'beyond our
ken'? My darling, why did you ask me that strange question?"</p>

<p>He took her little trembling hand in his and looked searchingly
into her face.</p>

<p>"Leslie," she said, "I have such a strange feeling. Perhaps
you will laugh at it. I should have laughed at it myself two
hours ago."</p>

<p>"Tell me, dear," he pleaded; "I will not even smile."</p>

<p>She looked up with something like awe shining in her large
eyes.</p>

<p>"Leslie, I can hardly find words to put this strong presentiment
in; but I feel that if we part now&mdash;like this&mdash;that before
you win the honors you covet, some terrible bar of fate will come
between us and sunder us so widely that we shall never meet
again."</p>

<p>The low, impressive words fell heavily on his heart, chilling it
like ice. How strangely they sounded from his little Bonnibel,
who but an hour ago was as gay as a butterfly in the sunshine.
Now the very elements of tragedy were in her voice and face. A
jealous pang struck him to the heart.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he said, quietly, "do you mean that your uncle
would marry you to someone else before I came back to claim
you?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," she said; "I hardly think my feeling was as
clearly defined as that. It was a dim, intangible something I
could not fathom, and took no peculiar shape. But he might try
to do that, for, oh, Leslie! Uncle Francis is terribly angry with
us both."</p>

<p>"I am quite aware of that, my dearest," he answered, bitterly.
"But, Bonnibel, this presentiment of yours troubles me.
Perhaps I am foolish, but I have always been a half-way believer
in these things."</p>

<p>"Leslie, I believe it firmly," she said, choking back a sob that
rose in her throat; "Uncle Francis will dig some impassable gulf
between us. When we part to-night, it will be forever."</p>

<p>Hiding her face on his shoulder she sobbed aloud. Poor little
bonny bird! she had been soaring in the blue ether, her fair
plumage bathed in sunshine all her life. Now her bright wings
were clipped, and she walked in the shadow.</p>

<p>"My love has only brought you sorrow," he said, regretfully.</p>

<p>"No, no; you must not think so," she answered, earnestly.
"It seems to me, Leslie, that I have never fully lived until this
summer, when I met and loved you. Life has seemed to have a
fuller, deeper meaning; the flowers have been sweeter, the sunshine
fairer, the sound of the sea has seemed to have a voice that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
spake to me of happiness. If you had gone away from me with
your love untold I should have missed something from my life
forever. You do not guess what a wealth of love is in my heart,
Leslie. It is not your love that brings me sorrow; it is the dreadful,
dreadful parting with you!"</p>

<p>He pressed her hand in silence. A terrible temptation had
come to him. He was struggling mutely against it, trying to
fight it down in all honor. But love and jealousy fought madly
against white-handed honor.</p>

<p>"If you leave her now, in her beauty and youth," whispered
jealousy, "some other man will see that she is fair. She will
forget you and wed another."</p>

<p>"Make her your own <i>now</i>," whispered love.</p>

<p>He was young and ardent; the warm blood of the South, whose
flame burns so hotly, fired his veins. He looked at her sitting
there so angelically fair in the beautiful moonlight, and knew
that he should never love another as he loved this beautiful, innocent
child. If she were lost to his future life what profit could
he have in wealth and fame? Love and jealousy conquered.</p>

<p>He drew her to his side with a passionate clasp, longing to hold
her there forever.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he whispered, "do not be frightened at what I
am going to say. I am afraid that they will marry you to some
other while I am gone away. Your uncle may persuade you
against your will, may even bring force to bear with you. But
there is one way in which we can bridge any gulf they may dig
between us, darling. Will you marry me secretly to-night? I
can leave you more willingly, then, knowing that no power can
keep us apart when I come to claim you."</p>

<p>"Marry you to-night?" gasped the child. "How can I do
that, Leslie?"</p>

<p>"Nothing easier, darling. Only a mile and a half from here is
the little fishing village of Brandon. We can take your little
skiff and go down, be married by the Methodist minister there,
and return in a few hours, and then I can leave you without
being haunted by a terrible foreboding of losing you forever.
They will think you are asleep in your room at home, and no one
will miss you or be the wiser for the precious little secret that
we will keep sacredly until I come to claim my little wife. Bonnibel,
will you make this great sacrifice for love? It will make
our future happiness secure."</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered, without a moment's thought.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>The fairy little bark, the <i>Bonnibel</i>, swept blithely out into the
moonlighted waves.</p>

<p>Bonnibel tied her lace handkerchief over her head, and wrapped
the shawl about her shoulders.</p>

<p>Somehow her heart began to grow lighter. This moonlight flitting
seemed so sweet and romantic.</p>

<p>Her dark-eyed lover sitting opposite lightly swaying the oars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
looked handsome as a demi-god to her partial eyes. She trusted
him implicitly.</p>

<p>"The king can do no wrong," was her motto.</p>

<p>"You shall never regret this step, never, my darling," Leslie
Dane kept saying to her over and over, as if to soothe his conscience,
which perhaps reproached him.</p>

<p>And Bonnibel answered with a smile every time, "I never expect
to regret it, Leslie, dear."</p>

<p>His rapid strokes of the oar soon brought them to their destination.
Brandon was a poor little fishing village consisting only
of the rude huts of the fishermen, a little Methodist chapel, and
a little parsonage down by the shore rather neater than the rest
of the shanties.</p>

<p>Here lived the aged minister and his kind old wife. Thither
the young artist directed his steps with Bonnibel clinging to his
arm.</p>

<p>Fortunately they met no one on the way, and almost before
they knew it they stood in the shabby "best room," which served
the good man for study, library and parlor.</p>

<p>There the minister sat with his books, and the good wife with
her knitting.</p>

<p>Leslie Dane drew the old man aside and they held a brief whispered
colloquy. Apparently the young man made everything
satisfactory, for in a minute he came back and led Bonnibel forward
to breathe those solemn vows which are so quickly cemented
but which death alone can sunder.</p>

<p>Bonnibel was trembling very much, though the hitherto
thoughtless child did not in the least realize the magnitude of the
step she was taking.</p>

<p>She only thought to herself how sweet it would be to be bound
by that sacred tie to Leslie Dane, and she quivered from head to
foot with pleasure, and with a certain indefinable nervousness
she did not begin to understand, while the two old people stared
at her in surprise at her radiant beauty and costly dress.</p>

<p>The solemn words were soon spoken, Leslie making the responses
firmly, and Bonnibel in a hushed little voice that was
scarcely audible. The young man slipped a ring over her finger
that he had always worn on his own, the minister blessed them,
the good wife kissed the girl with tears in her eyes, for women
always weep at a wedding. Then Leslie slipped a generous fee
into the old man's hand, and led his blushing bride away.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my darling, and may you always look back to
this hour as the happiest one of your life," he whispered, as he
put her into the little skiff and kissed her beautiful lips with an
outburst of passionate tenderness.</p>

<p>"I wish you the same happiness, Leslie," whispered the happy
little bride.</p>

<p>"In a little while now we shall be parted," said he; "oh, my
Bonnibel, how much easier the parting will be when I know that
I am leaving my wife behind me&mdash;my wife whom no one can
keep from me when I come for her."</p>

<p>"It was a happy thought of yours to bind me thus," answered
the young bride, softly. "Now that grim presentiment will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
haunt me no more, and Uncle Francis cannot hurt me with his
threats or his coldness while I have this precious secret in my
heart."</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he said, anxiously, "in some moments of defiance
you may feel tempted to taunt him by the betrayal of our marriage;
but I implore you do not yield to the temptation. More
serious consequences may follow than you dream of. Let our
secret be a dead secret until I give you leave to proclaim it."</p>

<p>"I will never reveal it, Leslie, I give you my solemn word of
honor," replied Bonnibel, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Thanks dearest. I only asked the promise because I knew
it was for the best. Darling, I shall think of you always while I
am absent, and I will write to you very often. Will you write
to me sometimes, and let me know that you are well and
happy?"</p>

<p>"I will write to you often and let you know that I am well;
but I can never be happy while I am separated from you, Leslie,"
she said, sadly.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel, how beautiful you look in that white dress," he
said, changing the conversation abruptly, seeing that it pained
her. "You were the finest bride I ever saw."</p>

<p>"It is a pretty dress," she said, looking down at the soft mass
of muslin and lace; "but I little thought when I put it on for
dinner this evening that it would be my bridal dress. I shall always
love this dress, Leslie. I will keep it always in memory of
to-night."</p>

<p>Both were silent after a little while, till Leslie said, abruptly:</p>

<p>"Bonnibel, I wish I knew of what you are thinking so intently."</p>

<p>"I was hardly thinking at all," she said, quickly. "Some
verses were running through my mind that I read this evening
in Jean Ingelow's pretty poems. I hardly understood them then,
but they seem to suit my feelings now."</p>

<p>"Let me hear them," said Leslie.</p>

<p>"I cannot recall them, except the last verse. The poem was
called 'Divided,' and the last verse, which is all that I clearly
recollect, ran thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'And yet I know, past all doubting truly&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A knowledge greater than grief can dim&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I know as he loved he will love me duly,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yea, better, e'en better than I love him.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And as I walk by the vast, calm river,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The awful river so dread to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I say, thy breadth and thy depth forever<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Are bridged by his thoughts that cross to me.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Beautiful," said Leslie, as the full voice, tremulous with newly
awakened feeling died away. "You must always recall those
lines when you think of me, my little one."</p>

<p>The keel grated on the shore. Leslie looked at his watch in
the moonlight.</p>

<p>"It is later than I thought," he said, hurriedly, as he helped
Bonnibel out upon the shore. "I have but fifteen minutes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
reach the station. Darling, I must go to-night, though it nearly
kills me to leave you."</p>

<p>She turned quivering and weeping, to throw herself upon his
breast.</p>

<p>"Darling, you are not afraid to go to the house alone?" he
whispered. "My time is so short!"</p>

<p>"No, no," she said. "But, Leslie, how <i>can</i> I let you go?"</p>

<p>"'Tis but a little while," he answered, soothingly. "Be brave,
my precious darling!"</p>

<p>He drew her to his heart with a long, despairing embrace, and
kissed her passionately.</p>

<p>"My little love, my own sweet <i>wife</i>, good-bye!" he faltered,
and was gone.</p>

<p>Bonnibel threw out her yearning arms as if she would draw
him back, then turned and staggered homeward.</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> be brave," she murmured. "I will try to bear it, but,
oh, this pain at my heart."</p>

<p>She opened the gate and went softly up the walk. It was
almost midnight, and she began to wonder if the doors would be
locked.</p>

<p>"If they are I shall have to get in through the window," she
said to herself.</p>

<p>But as she stepped on the piazza she saw the front door open
and her uncle sitting motionless in his easy chair.</p>

<p>"Poor dear," she thought, with a thrill of regretful tenderness,
and forgetting herself entirely. "He has fallen asleep in
his chair and they have all forgotten him. I will wake him with
a kiss."</p>

<p>He lay with his head thrown back, apparently fast asleep.
Gliding softly along, she threw her arm about his neck and, bending
over, pressed her sweet lips to his brow.</p>

<p>She started back with a shiver and looked at him. The brow
she had kissed was cold as ice. Her hand fell down upon his
breast and came in contact with something wet and cold. She
lifted her hand and saw upon it in the moonlight a dark stain.</p>

<p>"Uncle!" she screamed, "oh, God, uncle, wake up!"</p>

<p>That wild scream of agony roused the house. The servants
came rushing out, but before they reached her Bonnibel had
fallen fainting at her uncle's feet. The beautiful white dress she
had promised to keep in memory of that night was all dabbled and
stained in a pool of his life-blood that had dripped down upon the
floor.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>Francis Arnold was dead. The soul of the proud millionaire,
the disappointed husband, the loving uncle, had been hurried
prematurely before the bar of Eternal Justice. In the stillness of
the summer night while he rested in fancied security beneath
his own roof-tree, the angel of sleep pressing down his weary
eye-lids, the deadly destroyer had crept to his side, and red-handed
murder had struck the cowardly blow that spilled his life
blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>They came hurrying out&mdash;the servants first, the wife next, the
step-daughter last&mdash;all roused by that piercing shriek of agony&mdash;and
found him sitting there dead, with Bonnibel lying lifeless at
his feet, her white robes dabbled and stained in the blood upon
the floor.</p>

<p>They brought lights and looked at him. Yes, he was cold and
dead. There was a great scarlet stain on his white vest where
the deadly weapon had entered his heart. The blood had dripped
down in a great pool upon the floor and was fast stiffening
on his garments.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold shrieked aloud and went into horrible hysterics,
laughing wildly and maniacally, and tearing her hair from its
fastenings; but Felise Herbert stood still as a statue of horror,
looking at the dismal scene. Her pale face was paler than ever,
and her large, black eyes looked wildly about her. She made no
effort to arrest her mother's frenzied cries, but stood still as if
frozen into ice, while the maids lifted up the still form of poor
Bonnibel and carried her through the drawing-room window,
laying her down gently, and applying restoratives.</p>

<p>Life came swiftly back to her under their influence. She lifted
her head, and opened her eyes upon the faces around her just as
a shrill and piercing whistle announced the departure of the
train which was bearing her young husband away from her
for years&mdash;perhaps forever.</p>

<p>Bonnibel sprang up and went out on the piazza again. As she
stepped to the side of that lifeless form, Felise Herbert, just waking
from her apparent trance of horror, waved her hands in the
air, and cried out solemnly and sepulchrally:</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven! It is Leslie Dane who has done this dreadful
deed. That was what he meant by his dark threats this evening!"</p>

<p>"Leslie Dane has killed him!" echoed her mother, wildly.</p>

<p>"It is false, woman! How dare you accuse him of such a
deed?" Bonnibel cried out fiercely, wild with grief and horror;
then suddenly she looked at the half-dazed men-servants standing
around their master helplessly.</p>

<p>"Idiots!" she cried, "why do you stand here idle? Why does
not some one bring a doctor? Perhaps he is not dead yet&mdash;he
may be revived."</p>

<p>They brought a physician at her bidding, but when he came
his services were needed for her, not for the pale corpse down
stairs that would nevermore want the physician's potent art.
They had taken her by force to her room, where she was wildly
walking the floor, wringing her hands and raving over her loss.</p>

<p>"You are dead, Uncle Francis," she cried, passionately; "you
will never speak to me again. And I had left you in anger. We
never quarreled before&mdash;never! And without a good-bye kiss,
without a forgiving word, you are gone from me into the darkness
of death! They have killed you, my dear one!&mdash;who
could have been so cruel?&mdash;and you will never know how I loved
you, and that I forgave you for your cruelty so soon, or that I
wished to be reconciled. Oh, God! Oh, God!"</p>

<p>She told her story frankly to the good old doctor when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
came and questioned her. She and her uncle had quarreled because
he had denied her a darling wish. She had rushed out of
the house in a fit of anger, and moped about the seashore until
late into the night. Then she had returned, and seeing him sitting
there on the piazza she had felt her anger melting into tenderness,
and stolen up to give him the kiss of reconciliation, but
found him cold and dead.</p>

<p>She told the same story when the inquest was held next day,
blushing crimson when they asked her what she and her uncle
had quarreled over.</p>

<p>"It was a purely personal matter," she answered, hesitatingly.
"Is it necessary to reveal it?"</p>

<p>They told her it was necessary.</p>

<p>"He refused to sanction my engagement to my lover, and
drove him away from the house with cruel, insulting words,"
she answered briefly through her tears and blushes.</p>

<p>"And you were very angry with your uncle?"</p>

<p>"Yes; for a little while," she answered frankly; "but when I
came back to the house I was ready to forgive him and be
friends with him again. He had never been unkind to me before,
but indulged me in every wish, and petted me as my own
father might have done had he lived. I was almost wild at
first with surprise and anger at the first denial I had ever received
from him; but I soon overcame my indignant feelings,
and when I came back to the house I loved him as fondly as
ever."</p>

<p>She left the room immediately after giving in her evidence,
overcome with grief and emotion, and going to her room, threw
herself down upon the bed, from which she did not rise again
for many weeks. Grief and excitement precipitated her into a
brain fever, and for many days life and death fought persistently
over their unhappy victim.</p>

<p>Had she known what would take place after she left the
room she would have remained until the inquest was over.
Felise Herbert and her mother boldly declared their belief that
Leslie Dane was the murderer of Mr. Arnold. From the drawing-room
windows which opened out on the piazza they had
overheard the conversation between the two men relative to
Bonnibel, and they detailed every word, maliciously misrepresenting
Leslie Dane's indignant words so as to place the worst
construction upon them. One or two of the servants had heard
also, and from all the testimony elicited the jury readily found a
verdict of willful homicide against Leslie Dane, and a warrant
was issued for the young man's arrest.</p>

<p>But poor little Bonnibel, tossing up-stairs in her fevered delirium,
knew nothing of all this. If she had known she might
easily have cleared her lover from that foul charge by proving
that he had been with her during those fatal hours in which Mr.
Arnold had met his death.</p>

<p>It remained for her to prove his innocence at a darker hour
than this, and at the sacrifice of much that she held dear.</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold's body was carried to his winter residence in New
York, and buried from thence with all the pomp and splendor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
due to his wealth and station. Felise and her mother, of course,
accompanied the remains.</p>

<p>The housekeeper at the seaside home was left in charge of the
hapless Bonnibel, who lay sick unto death in her luxurious
chamber, tended carefully by hirelings and strangers, but with
never one kiss of love to fall on her fevered brow in sympathy
and tenderness.</p>

<p>Love had gone out of her life. With the young husband adrift
now on the wide sea, and the kindly uncle lying in his gory grave,
love had gone away from her.</p>

<p>She had no kindred now from whom to claim tenderness or
care, so only hirelings were left to watch the spark of life flickering
so feebly day by day, that it seemed as if it must surely go
out in darkness. They were all who heard the wild, passionate
appeals for Leslie and Uncle Francis that were always on the
sufferer's lips as she babbled incoherently in her wild delirium.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold and Felise remained in New York for several
weeks, attending to business affairs and superintending the making
up of very fashionable and cumbrous mourning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold did not provide any of this raiment for Bonnibel.
She sincerely hoped that the girl would die of her fever and preclude
the necessity of so doing.</p>

<p>But youth is very tenacious of life. Bonnibel, in her illness
and desolation, would willingly have died to please her aunt, but
destiny had decreed otherwise.</p>

<p>There came a cool, still night in September when the nurses
hung carefully around the bed waiting for the crisis that the doctor
had said would come at midnight. It came, and the reaper,
Death, with his sickle keen, passed by on the other side.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile outraged justice was on the <i>qui vive</i> for the
escaped homicide, Leslie Dane. It was rumored that he had
sought refuge in a foreign land, but nothing definite could be
learned regarding his mysterious whereabouts.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>October winds were blowing coolly over the sea before Bonnibel
Vere arose from her sick-bed, the pale and wasted shadow
of her former rosy and bewildering self.</p>

<p>She had convalesced but slowly&mdash;too slowly, the physician
said, for one of her former perfect health and fine constitution.
But the weight of grief hung heavily upon her, paralyzing her
energies so completely that the work of recuperation went on
but slowly.</p>

<p>Two months had elapsed since that dreadful night in which so
much had taken place&mdash;her secret marriage and her uncle's
murder.</p>

<p>She should have had a letter from her young husband ere this,
but it was in vain that she asked for the mail daily. No letter
and no message came from the wanderer, and to the pangs of
grief were added the horrors of suspense and anxiety.</p>

<p>A look of weary, wistful waiting crept into the bonnie blue
eyes that had of old been as cloudless and serene as the blue skies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of summer. The rose forgot to come back to her cheek, the
smile to her lips. The shadow of a sad heart was reflected on
her beauty.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Upon her face there was the tint of grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The settled shadow of an inward strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And an unquiet drooping of the eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As if its lid were charged with unshed tears."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first day she sat up Mrs. Arnold came in to see her. She
had only returned from the city a few days before and was making
preparations to go back for the winter season. She sent the
nurse away, saying that she would sit with Miss Vere a little
while herself.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day, warm and sunny for the season, and Bonnibel
sat in her easy-chair near the window where she could look
out upon the wide expanse of the ocean with its restless blue
waves rolling in upon the shore with a solemn murmur. She
loved the sea, and was always sorry when the family left their
beautiful home, Sea View, for their winter residence in the city.</p>

<p>"You have grown very thin, Bonnibel," said her aunt, giving
her a very scrutinizing glance, as she reclined in her chair, wrapped
in a warm, white cashmere dressing gown, to which her
maid had added a few bows of black velvet in token of her bereavement.
"It is a pity the doctor had to shave your hair.
You look a fright."</p>

<p>Bonnibel put her hand up to her brow and touched the soft, babyish
rings of gold that began to cluster thickly about her blue-veined
temples.</p>

<p>"It is growing out again very fast," she said; "and it does not
matter any way. There is no one to care for my looks now," she
added, thinking of the uncle and the lover who had doted so
fondly on her perfect loveliness.</p>

<p>"It matters more than you think, Bonnibel," said Mrs. Arnold,
sharply, the lines of vexation deepening in her face. "It behooves
you to be as beautiful as you can now, for your face is your fortune."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, aunt," said the young girl, gravely.</p>

<p>"It is time you should, then," was the vexed rejoinder, "I
suppose you think now, Bonnibel, that your poor uncle has left
you a fortune?"</p>

<p>Bonnibel looked at her in surprise, and the widow's eyes shifted
uneasily beneath her gaze.</p>

<p>"Of course I believe that Uncle Francis has provided for my
future," said the girl, quietly.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, then," snapped the widow; "Mr. Arnold
died without a will and failed to provide for either you or Felise.
Of course, in that case, I inherit everything; and, as I remarked
just now, your face is your fortune."</p>

<p>"My uncle died without a will!" repeated Bonnibel in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mrs. Arnold answered, coolly.</p>

<p>"Oh, but, aunt, you must be mistaken," said Bonnibel,
quickly, while a slight flush of excitement tinted her pale cheeks.
"Uncle Francis did leave a will. I am sure of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then where is it?" inquired Mrs. Arnold.</p>

<p>"In his desk in the library," said the girl confidently. "He
told me but a few hours before his death that he had made his
will, and provided liberally for me, and he said it was at that
minute lying in his desk."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you have quite recovered from the delirium of
your fever?" inquired the widow, scornfully. "This must be
one of the vagaries of illness."</p>

<p>"I am as sane as you are, madam," said Bonnibel, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," sneered Mrs. Arnold, rustling uneasily in the folds
of her heavy black crape. "However that may be, no will has
been found, either in the desk or in the hands of his lawyer,
where it should most probably be. The lawyer admits drawing
one up for him years ago, but thinks he must have destroyed it
later, as no trace of it can be found."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to live upon, then," said Bonnibel, vaguely.</p>

<p>She did not comprehend the extent of the calamity that had
fallen upon her. Her sorrow was too fresh for her mind to dwell
upon the possibilities of the future that lay darkly before her.</p>

<p>"You have absolutely nothing," repeated Mrs. Arnold, grimly.
"Your father left you nothing but <i>fame</i>; your uncle left you
nothing but <i>love</i>. You will find it difficult to live upon either."</p>

<p>Bonnibel stared at her blankly.</p>

<p>"You are utterly penniless," Mrs. Arnold repeated, coarsely.</p>

<p>"Then what am I to do?" asked the girl, gravely, twisting her
little white hands uneasily together.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose?" the lady inquired, with a significant
glance.</p>

<p>A scarlet banner fluttered into the white cheeks of the lovely
invalid. The tone and glance of the coarse woman wounded her
pride deeply.</p>

<p>"You will want me to go away from here, I suppose," she
answered, quietly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold straightened herself in her chair, and to Bonnibel's
surprise assumed an air of wounded feeling.</p>

<p>"There, now, Bonnibel," said she, in a tone of reproach, "that
is just like you. I never expected that you, spoiled child as you
are, would ever do me justice; but do you think I could be so
unfeeling as to cast you, a poor orphan child, out upon the cold
charity of the world?"</p>

<p>Bonnibel's guileless little heart was deceived by this dramatic
exhibition of fine feeling. She began to think she had done her
uncle's wife injustice.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, aunt," she answered, gently. "I did not know
what your feelings would be upon the subject. I know my uncle
intended to provide for me."</p>

<p>"But since he signally failed to do so I will see that you do
not suffer," said the widow, loftily; "of course, I am not legally
compelled to do so, but I will keep you with me and care for you
the same as I do for my own daughter, until you marry, which, I
trust, will not be long after you lay aside your mourning. A
girl as pretty as you, even without fortune, ought to make an
early and advantageous settlement in life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The whiteness of the girl's fair, childish face was again suffused
with deep crimson.</p>

<p>"I shall never marry," she answered, sadly, thinking of the
lover-husband who had left her months ago, and from whose
silence she felt that he must be dead; "never, never!"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Mrs. Arnold, impatiently; "all the girls talk
that way, but they marry all the same. I should be sorry to have
to take care of you all your life. I expect you and Felise to
marry when a suitable <i>parti</i> presents himself. My daughter
already has an admirer in New York whom she would do well to
accept. He is very old, but then he is a millionaire."</p>

<p>She arose, stately, handsome and dignified.</p>

<p>"Felise and I return to New York Saturday," she said. "Will
you be strong enough to accompany us?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," said Bonnibel, faintly.</p>

<p>"Very well. Your maid and the housekeeper will take care of
you in our absence. I will send you a traveling suit of mourning,
and when you feel strong enough you can come to us."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam," Bonnibel answered, and the wealthy widow
left the room.</p>

<p>So in a few weeks after, while nature was putting off her gay
livery and donning winter hues, Bonnibel laid aside the bright
garments she had been wont to wear, as she had already laid
aside the joy and gladness of her brief spring of youth, and donning
the black robes of bereavement and bitterness,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Took up the cross of her life again,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Saying only it might have been."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The day before she left Sea View she went down to the shore
to have a parting row in her pretty little namesake, the <i>Bonnibel</i>.</p>

<p>She had delayed her return to the city as long as possible, but
now she was growing stronger she felt that she had no further
excuse to dally in the home she loved so well, and which was so
inseparably connected with the two beloved ones so sadly lost&mdash;the
uncle who had gone away from her through the gates of
death, and the young husband who seemed separated from her
just as fatally by time and distance.</p>

<p>As she walked slowly down to the shore in the beautiful
autumnal sunshine it seemed to her they both were dead. No
message came to her from that far Italy, which was the beloved
Mecca of Leslie's hopes and aspirations. He had never reached
there, she told herself. Perhaps shipwreck and disaster had befallen
him on the way.</p>

<p>No thought of his forgetfulness or falsity crossed the mind of
the loyal little bride. It seemed to her that death was the only
thing that could have thrown that strange gulf of silence between
their hearts.</p>

<p>She sprang into the little skiff&mdash;one of her uncle's loving gifts
to his niece&mdash;and suffered it to drift out into the blue waves. A
fresh breeze was blowing and the water was rather rough. The
breeze blew the soft, short rings of gold merrily about her white
temples where the blue veins were seen wandering beneath the
transparent skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The last time she had been out rowing her hair had flouted like
a banner of gold on the breeze, and her cheek had glowed crimson
as the sunny side of a peach.</p>

<p>Now the shorn locks and the marble pallor of her cheeks told
a different story. Love and beauty had both left her, she thought,
mournfully. Yet nature was as lovely as ever, the blue sky
was mirrored as radiantly in the blue sea, the sunshine still
shone brightly, the breeze still whispered as tenderly to its sweethearts,
the flowers. She alone was sad.</p>

<p>She stayed out a long while. It was so sunny and warm it
seemed like a summer instead of an autumn day. The sea-gulls
sported joyously above the surface of the water, now and then a
silvery fish leaped up in the sunshine, its scales shining in beautiful
rainbow hues, and shedding the crystal drops of spray from
its body like a shower of diamonds, and the curlew's call echoed
over the sea. How she had loved these things in the gay and
careless girlhood that began to seem so far away in the past.</p>

<p>"That was Bonnibel Vere," she said to herself, "the girl that
never knew a sorrow. I am Bonnibel Dane, whose life must lie
forever in the shadow!"</p>

<p>She turned her course homeward, and as she stepped upon the
shore she picked out a little blue sea-flower that grew in a crevice
of the rock, and stood still a moment looking out over the blue
expanse of ocean, and repeating some pretty lines she had always
loved:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis sweet to sit midst a merry throng<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the woods, and hear the wild-bird's song;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But sweeter far is the ceaseless dirge,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The music low of the moaning surge;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It frets and foams on the shell-strewn shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Forever and ever, and evermore.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I crave no flower from the wood or field,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No rare exotic that hot-beds yield;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Give me the weeds that wildly cling,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the barren rocks their shelter fling;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Those are the flowers beloved by me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They grow in the depths of the deep blue sea!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A sudden voice and step broke on her fancied solitude. She
turned quickly and found herself face to face with the wandering
sibyl, Wild Madge.</p>

<p>The half-crazed creature was, as usual, bare-headed, her white
locks streaming in the air, her frayed and tattered finery waving
fantastically about her lean, lithe figure. She looked at Bonnibel
with a hideous leer of triumph.</p>

<p>"Ah maiden!" she cried&mdash;"said I not truly that the bitter
waters of sorrow were about to flow over you? You will not
mock the old woman's predictions now."</p>

<p>Bonnibel stood silent, gazing in terrified silence at the croaking
old raven.</p>

<p>"Where is the gay young lover now?" cried Wild Madge
laughing wildly. "The summer lover who went away before
the summer waned? Is he false, or is he dead, maiden, that he
is not here to shelter that bonny head from the storms of sorrow?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Peace, woman," said Bonnibel, sadly. "Why do you intrude
on my grief with your unwelcome presence?"</p>

<p>"Unwelcome, is it, my bonnie bird? Ah, well! 'tis but a thankless
task to foretell the future to the young and thoughtless.
But, Bonnibel Vere, you will remember me, even though it be
but to hate me. I tell you your sorrows are but begun. New
perils environ your future. Think not that mine is but a boasted
art. Those things which are hidden from you lie open to the
gaze of Wild Madge like a painted page. She can read your
hands; she can read the stars; she can read the open face of
nature!"</p>

<p>"You rave, poor creature," said Bonnibel, turning away with
a shiver of unreasoning terror, and pursuing her homeward
way.</p>

<p>Wild Madge stood still on the shore a few minutes, looking
after the girl as her slim, black-robed figure walked away
with the slow step of weakness and weariness.</p>

<p>"It is a bonny maid," she said, aloud; "a bonny maid.
Beautiful as an angel, gentle as a dove. But beauty is a gift of
the gods, and seldom given for aught but sorrow."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>When Bonnibel arrived in New York the day after her rencontre
with the sibyl, she found her uncle's fine carriage in waiting
for her at the depot. Mrs. Arnold, though she would gladly
have cast the girl off, was too much afraid of the world's dictum
to carry her wishes into effect. She determined, therefore, that
society should have no cause to accuse her of failing in kindness
to her husband's orphan niece. She knew well what disapprobation
and censure a contrary course would have created, for the
beautiful daughter of the famous General Vere, though she had
not yet been formally introduced to society, was widely celebrated
for her grace and beauty, and her <i>debut</i>, while she had
been considered her uncle's heiress, had been anticipated with
much interest. Of course her penniless condition now would
make a great difference in the eyes of the fickle world of fashion,
but still Mrs. Arnold knew that nothing could deprive Bonnibel
of the prestige of birth and rank. The young mother who had
died in giving her birth, had been one of the proud and well-born
Arnolds. Her father, a gay and gallant soldier, though he had
quickly dissipated her mother's fortune, had yet left her a prouder
heritage than wealth&mdash;a fame that would live forever in the
annals of his country, perpetuating in history the name of the
chivalrous soldier who had gallantly fallen at the head of his command
while engaged in one of the most gallant actions on record.</p>

<p>So Bonnibel found a welcome, albeit a chilling one, waiting for
her in Mrs. Arnold's grand drawing-room when she arrived there
cold and weary. The mother and daughter touched her fingers
carelessly, and offered frigid congratulations upon her recovery.
Mrs. Arnold then dismissed her to her own apartments to rest
and refresh her toilet under the care of her maid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"You need not be jealous of her youth and beauty any more,
Felise," said Mrs. Arnold complacently to her daughter. "She
has changed almost beyond recognition. Did you ever see such
a fright?"</p>

<p>Felise Herbert, hovering over the bright fire that burned on the
marble hearth, looked up angrily.</p>

<p>"Mother, you talk like a fool," she said, roughly. "How can
you fail to see that she is more beautiful than ever? She only
looked like a great wax doll before with her pink cheeks and long
curls. Now with that new expression that has come into her face
she looks like a haunting picture. One could not forget such a
face. And mourning is perfectly becoming to her blonde complexion,
while my olive skin is rendered perfectly hideous by it.
I see no reason why I should spoil my looks by wearing black for
a man that was no relation of mine, and whom I cordially
hated!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold saw that Felise was in a passion, and she began to
grow nervous accordingly. Felise, if that were possible, was a
worse woman than her mother, and possessed an iron will. She
was the power behind the throne before whom Mrs. Arnold trembled
in fear and bowed in adoration.</p>

<p>She hastened to console the angry girl.</p>

<p>"I think you are mistaken, my dear," she said. "I cannot see
a vestige of prettiness left. Her hair is gone, her color has faded,
and she never smiles now to show the dimples that people used
to call so distracting. There are few that would give her a second
glance. Besides, what is beauty without wealth? You
know in our world it simply counts for nothing. She can never
rival you a second now that it is known that she has no money
and that you will be my heiress."</p>

<p>The sullen countenance of Felise began to grow brighter at the
latter consolatory clause.</p>

<p>"As to the black," pursued Mrs. Arnold, "of course you and I
know that it is a mere sham; but then, Felise, it is necessary to
make that much concession to the opinion of the world. How
they would cavil if you failed in that mark of respect to the
memory of your step-father."</p>

<p>"There is one consolation," said Felise, brightening up, "I can
lay it aside within a year."</p>

<p>"And then, no doubt, you will don the bridal robe as the wife
of the millionaire, Colonel Carlyle," Mrs. Arnold rejoined, with
an air of great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said her daughter, clouding over again; "but
you need not be so sure. He has not proposed yet."</p>

<p>"But he will soon," asserted the widow, confidently.</p>

<p>"I expected he would do so, until now," said Felise, sharply.
"The old dotard appeared to admire me very much; but since
Bonnibel Vere has returned to flaunt her baby-beauty before
him, his fickle fancy may turn to her. A pretty face can make
a fool of an old man, you know."</p>

<p>"We must keep her in the background, then," said Mrs.
Arnold, reassuringly. "Not that I am the least apprehensive of
danger, my dear, but since your fears take that direction he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
shall not see her until all is secure, and you must bring him to
the point as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"I have done my best," said Felise, "but he hovers on the
brink apparently afraid to take the leap. I cannot understand
such dawdling on the part of one who has already buried two
wives. He cannot be afflicted with timidity."</p>

<p>"We must give him a hint that I shall settle fifty thousand
dollars on you the day you marry," said her mother. "I have
heard that he is very avaricious. It is a common vice of age and
infirmity. He fears you will spend his wealth too freely."</p>

<p>"And so I will, if I get a chance," said Felise, coarsely. "I
have been stinted all my life by the stepfather who hated me.
Let me but become Mrs. Colonel Carlyle, and I assure you I will
queen it right royally."</p>

<p>"You would become the position very much," said the admiring
mother, "and I should be very proud of my daughter's
graceful ease in spending her husband's millions."</p>

<p>Miss Herbert's proud lips curled in triumph. She arose and
began to pace the floor restlessly, her eyes shining with pleased
anticipation of the day which she hoped was not far distant
when she would marry the rich man whose wealth she coveted,
and become a queen in society. She looked around her at the
splendor and elegance of her mother's drawing-room with dissatisfaction,
and resolved that her own should be far more fine
and costly, her attire more extravagant, and her diamonds more
splendid. She was tired of reigning with her mother. She
wanted to rule over a kingdom of her own.</p>

<p>Felise had no more heart than a stone. Her only god was
wealth, and her ambition was towering. She thought only of
self, and felt not the first emotion of gratitude to the mother
who had schemed and planned for her all her life. All she desired
was unbounded wealth and the power to rule in her own
right.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Miss Felise has caught a beau at last," said Bonnibel's maid
to her as she brushed the soft locks of her mistress. She had been
having a hasty chat with Miss Herbert's maid since her arrival
that day, and had gathered a good deal of gossip in the servants'
hall.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" asked Bonnibel, languidly, "what is his name,
Lucy?"</p>

<p>"He is a Colonel Carlyle, miss; a very old man Janet do say,
but worth his millions. He have buried his two wives already,
I hear, and Miss Herbert is like to be a third one. I wish him joy
of her; Janet knows what her temper is."</p>

<p>"You need not speak so, Lucy," said Bonnibel, reprovingly,
to the maid whose loquacity was far ahead of her grammar. "I
daresay Janet gives her cause to indulge in temper sometimes."</p>

<p>"Lor! Miss Bonnibel," said Lucy, "Janet is as mild as a dove;
but Miss Felise, she have slapped Janet's mouth twice, and scolds
her day in and day out. Janet says that Colonel Carlyle will
catch a Tartar when he gets her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be quiet, Lucy; my head aches," said Bonnibel, thinking it
very improper for the girl to discuss her superior's affairs so freely;
she therefore dismissed the subject and thought no more
about it, little dreaming that it was one portentous of evil to
herself.</p>

<p>Felise need not have troubled herself with the fear of Bonnibel's
rivalry. The young girl was only too willing to be kept in
the background. In the seclusion which Mrs. Arnold deemed it
proper to observe after their dreadful and tragic bereavement
they received but few visitors and Bonnibel was glad that her
recent illness was considered a sufficient pretext for denying
herself to even these few. Some there were&mdash;a few old friends
and one or two loving schoolmates&mdash;who refused to be denied
and whom Bonnibel reluctantly admitted, but these few found
her so changed in appearance and broken in spirit that they went
away marveling at her persistent grief for the uncle whom the
world blamed very much because he had failed to provide for
her as became her birth and position.</p>

<p>But while the world censured Mr. Arnold's neglect of her,
Bonnibel never blamed her uncle by word or thought. She believed
what he had told her on the memorable evening of his
death. He <i>had</i> provided for her, she knew, and the will, perhaps,
had been lost. What had become of it she could not conjecture,
but she was far from imputing foul play to anyone. The thought
never entered her mind. She was too pure and innocent herself
to suspect evil in others, and the overwhelming horror of her
uncle's tragic death still brooded over her spirit to the utter exclusion
of all other cares save <i>one</i>, and that one a sore, sore trial
that it needed all her energies to endure, the silence of Leslie
Dane and her anxieties regarding his fate; for still the days waned
and faded and no tidings came to the sick heart that waited in
passionate suspense for a sign from the loved and lost one.</p>

<p>Strange to say, she had never learned the fatal truth that Leslie
Dane stood charged with her uncle's murder, and that justice was
still on the alert to discover his whereabouts. During her severe
and nearly fatal illness all approach to the subject of the murder
had been prohibited by the careful physician, and on her convalescence
the newspapers had been excluded from her sight and
the subject tabooed in her presence. She had forgotten the
solemn charge of Felise Herbert and her mother that fatal night
which she had so indignantly refuted. Now she was spared
the knowledge that the malignity of the two women had succeeded
in fixing the crime on the innocent head of the man she
loved. Had Bonnibel known that fact she would have left Mrs.
Arnold's roof although starvation and death had been the inevitable
consequence. But she did not know, and so moped and
pined in her chamber, tearful and utterly despairing, oblivious
to the fact that she was doing what Felise most desired in thus
secluding herself.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p>A blind chance at last brought about the fatal meeting between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Bonnibel Vere and Colonel Carlyle which Felise Herbert so
greatly dreaded and deprecated.</p>

<p>As the autumn months merged into winter Bonnibel had developed
a new phase of her trouble. A great and exceeding restlessness
took possession of her.</p>

<p>She no longer moped in her chamber, thinking and thinking on
the one subject that began to obscure even the memory of
her Uncle Francis. She had brooded over Leslie's strange silence
until her brain reeled with agony&mdash;now a strange longing for
oblivion and forgetfulness took hold upon her.</p>

<p>"Oh! for that fabled Lethean draught which men drink and
straightway all the past is forgotten!" she would murmur wildly
as she paced the floor, wringing her beautiful hands and
weeping. "Either Leslie has deserted me or he is dead. In
either case it is wretchedness to remember him! Oh! that I
could forget!"</p>

<p>Shrouded in her thick veil and long cloak she began to take
long rambling walks every day, returning weary and fatigued,
so that sleep, which for awhile had deserted her pillow, began to
return, and in long and heavy slumbers she would lose for a little
while the memory of the handsome artist so deeply loved in
that brief and beautiful summer. Those days were gone forever.
Her brief spring of happiness was over. It seemed to her
that the only solace that remained to her weary heart was forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Once, rendered desperate by her suspense, she had written a
letter to Leslie&mdash;a long and loving letter, full of tender reproaches
for his silence, and containing the whole story of her
uncle's tragic death. She had begged him to send her just one
little line to assure her that she was not forgotten, and this
beautiful little letter, filled with the pure thoughts of her innocent
heart, she had directed to Rome, Italy.</p>

<p>No answer came to that yearning cry from the aching heart of
the little wife. She waited until hope became a hideous mockery.
She began to think how strange it was that she, little Bonnibel
Vere, who looked so much like a child, with her short hair,
and baby-blue eyes, was really a wife. But for the shining opal
ring with its pretty inscription, "Mizpah," which Leslie had
placed upon her finger that night, she would have begun to believe
that it was all a fevered dream.</p>

<p>She was thinking of that ring one day as she walked along the
crowded street, filled with eager shoppers, for Christmas was
drawing near, and people were busy providing holiday gifts for
their dear ones.</p>

<p>"<i>Mizpah!</i>" she repeated to herself, walking heedlessly along
the wet and sleety pavement. "That means '<i>the Lord watch between
thee and me while we are absent one from another</i>.' Oh, Leslie,
Leslie!"</p>

<p>Absorbed in painful thoughts she began to quicken her steps,
quite forgetful of the thin sheet of ice that covered the pavement,
and which required very careful walking. How it happened
she could not think, but the next moment she felt one
ankle twisting suddenly beneath her with a dreadful pain in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and found herself falling to the ground. With an exclamation
of terror she tried to recover her balance, but vainly. She lay
extended on the ground, her hat and veil falling off and exposing
her beautiful pale face with its clustering locks of sunny
hair.</p>

<p>People crowded around her immediately, but the first to reach
her was a gentleman who was coming out of a jewelry store in
front of which she had slipped and fallen.</p>

<p>He lifted her up tenderly, and a woman restored her hat and
veil.</p>

<p>Bonnibel tried to stand upon her feet and thank them both for
their timely aid.</p>

<p>To her terror a sharp twinge of pain in her ankle warned her
that she could not stand upon it. She uttered a cry of pain and
her blue eyes filled with quick tears.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I fear my ankle is sprained," she said, "I cannot stand
upon it."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the gentleman, melted by the tears and
the beauty of the sufferer. "Here is my carriage at the curbstone.
Give me your address and I will take you home immediately."</p>

<p>Bonnibel was growing so faint from the pain of her sprained
ankle that she could scarcely speak, but she murmured
brokenly: "Fifth Avenue, number &mdash;&mdash;," and with a slight exclamation
of surprise he lifted her into the carriage and gave the
order to the driver.</p>

<p>She leaned her head back against the satin cushions of the carriage
and closed her eyes wearily!</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said her companion's voice, arousing
her suddenly from the deathly faintness that was stealing over
her, "but I think you must be Miss Bonnibel Vere, Mrs.
Arnold's niece. Perhaps you have heard her mention me. I am
Colonel Carlyle."</p>

<p>Bonnibel opened her eyes with a start, and looked at him, instantly
recalling the gossip of her maid, Lucy. So this was
Colonel Carlyle, Felise Herbert's elderly lover. She gave him a
quick, curious glance.</p>

<p>He was an old man, certainly, and apparently made no attempt
to disguise the fact, for the curling locks that still clustered
abundantly on his head were silvered by time, as well as the
long beard that flowed down upon his breast.</p>

<p>His features were aristocratic in contour, his mouth rather
stern, his eyes still dark and piercing, though he could not have
been less than seventy years old. He was dressed with taste and
elegance, and his stately form was quite erect and stately.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have heard of you, Colonel Carlyle," Bonnibel
answered, quietly, "but I cannot imagine how you could know
who I am. We have never met before."</p>

<p>"No," he answered, with a gallant bow and smile, "we have
not, I have never had the happiness of meeting you, though I
have frequently visited at your home. But the fame of Miss
Vere's beauty has gone forth into the land, and when you named
your address I knew you could be no other."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Bonnibel bowed silently. Something in the graceful flattery of
his words or tone jarred upon her. Besides, she was in such pain
from her ankle that she felt it an effort to speak.</p>

<p>He observed the whiteness of her face, and said quickly:</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but I fear you are suffering from your sprain."</p>

<p>"Somewhat," she admitted, through her white lips.</p>

<p>"Bear it as bravely as you can," he said. "In a few minutes
you will be at home, and can have medical attention. Sprains
are quite serious things sometimes, though I hope yours may not
result that way."</p>

<p>"I hope not," she echoed, growing paler and paler, and biting
her lips to repress the moan of pain that trembled on them. She
was really suffering acute pain from the twisted ankle.</p>

<p>He was silent a minute, studying the beautiful, pale face with
admiring eyes.</p>

<p>She looked up and met a world of deep sympathy shining on
her from his keen, dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I was very fortunate in meeting you, Colonel Carlyle," she
said, gently. "Believe me, I am much indebted for your timely
aid."</p>

<p>"I am glad to have been of service to your father's daughter,"
said the colonel, bowing. "I knew your father intimately in the
army, Miss Vere. We were friends, though the general was my
junior in age and my superior in rank. I have often wondered
what poor Harry's daughter was like. He was so frank, so handsome,
so chivalrous, so daring."</p>

<p>The girl's blue eyes lit up with pleasure at his praise of the father
who had died in her infancy, but whose memory she loved
and revered. She put out her hand, saying proudly:</p>

<p>"I thank you for your praise of him, Colonel Carlyle. Let my
father's friend be mine also."</p>

<p>And the wealthy colonel gave the little hand a fervent pressure,
feeling that those timely words of his had gained him a great
advantage&mdash;one of which he would not be slow to avail himself.</p>

<p>He was about to express his pride and satisfaction at her words
in glowing terms when, with a faint cry, she sank back against
the cushions and closed her eyes. She had succumbed to her
pain in spite of herself and fainted.</p>

<p>Fortunately they were within a block of the house. The colonel
seated himself beside her and supported her helpless head on
his arm until the carriage stopped in front of Mrs. Arnold's splendid
brown-stone mansion. Then he carefully lifted the fair burden
in his arms and carried her across the pavement and up the steps,
where he rang the bell.</p>

<p>The obsequious servant who opened the door to him stared in
surprise and alarm at his burden, but silently threw open the
drawing-room door, where Felise and her mother sat in company
with a few visitors.</p>

<p>Both sprang up in bewilderment as Colonel Carlyle entered
with a bow and laid the insensible Bonnibel down upon the sofa.
She looked like one dead as she lay there with her closed eyes and
deathly-white face, and limp hands hanging down helplessly.</p>

<p>"What has happened, Colonel Carlyle?" demanded Felise, stepping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
forward, as he bent over Bonnibel, while her mother and the
guests echoed her words: "What has happened?"</p>

<p>"Miss Vere slipped and fell upon the ice," he answered, "and
has sustained some serious injury. She has suffered much pain.
Let her have medical attendance at once."</p>

<p>"But you," said Felise, abruptly, and almost rudely. "How
came you with her?"</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle looked at her in slight surprise.</p>

<p>"I was about crossing the pavement to enter my carriage," he
explained, rather coolly, "when the accident occurred, and I had
the happiness to be of service in bringing her home."</p>

<p>And Felise, as she watched him bending anxiously over the
girl she hated, wished in her heart that Bonnibel Vere might
never recover from the swoon that looked so much like death.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p>"A merry Christmas, Bonnibel, and many happy returns of
the day."</p>

<p>Bonnibel Vere, lying helplessly on the sofa in her dressing-room,
looked up with a start of surprise.</p>

<p>Felise Herbert was entering with her cat-like steps and a deceitful
smile wreathing her thin lips.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Felise," she answered wearily, "though your
wishes can scarcely bear fruit to-day."</p>

<p>"Are you suffering so much pain to-day?" asked Felise, dropping
into an easy-chair and resting her head with its crown of
dark braids against its violet velvet lining.</p>

<p>"My ankle is rather painful."</p>

<p>"We are going to have a few friends to dine with us to-day&mdash;Colonel
Carlyle is among them&mdash;and we thought&mdash;mother and I&mdash;that
you might be well enough to come down into the drawing-room,"
said the visitor, watching the invalid keenly under her
drooping lashes.</p>

<p>But the feverish flush on the girl's cheek did not deepen under
the jealous scrutiny of the watcher. She watched with a sigh of
positive relief.</p>

<p>"Many thanks, but it is not possible for me to do so, Felise;
Doctor Graham said that I must remain closely confined to my
sofa at least two weeks. And indeed I could not leave it if I
tried. My foot is much swollen and I cannot stand at all."</p>

<p>She pushed out the little member from under the skirt of her
warm white wrapper, and Felise saw that she spoke truly.</p>

<p>She rose and came nearer under pretense of examining it.</p>

<p>"Why, what a pretty little ring you wear&mdash;is it a new one?"
said she suddenly, and in an instant she had dexterously slipped it
off Bonnibel's finger, and, holding it up, read the inscription
within, "Mizpah!" "Why, how romantic! Is it a love token,
Bonnibel?"</p>

<p>Bonnibel's lips were quivering like a grieved child's, and quick
tears sprang into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Felise," she said, reproachfully, "you should not have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
it off. I never meant for that ring to leave my finger while I
lived, never!"</p>

<p>Felise laughed&mdash;a low, sneering laugh&mdash;and tossed her jetty
braids.</p>

<p>"Here, take your ring," she said scornfully; "I did not know
you were going to be such a baby over it. It must have been the
gift of a lover to be so highly prized&mdash;perhaps it was given you
by Leslie Dane."</p>

<p>Bonnibel slipped the ring back on her tapering third finger,
while a hot flush mounted to her brow.</p>

<p>"You seem very curious over my ring, Felise," she said, angrily.
"I do not suppose it can matter to you at all who the giver may
be."</p>

<p>"Oh! not in the least," said Felise, airily. "I beg your pardon
for teasing you about it. But if someone should give me a
prettier ring than that soon I should not mind telling you the
donor. And by the way," said she, walking to the window and
peering out through the lace curtains, "you must tell me, Bonnibel,
how you liked Colonel Carlyle the other day."</p>

<p>"I should be very ungrateful if I did not like him very well,"
said the girl, simply. "He was very good to me."</p>

<p>"That is an evasive answer," said Felise, laughing. "Should
you have liked him if you had not been prompted thereto by
gratitude?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I do not know. I was suffering such acute pain I
hardly thought of him until he told me he had been an intimate
friend of my papa while in the army. And he praised papa so
highly I could not choose but like him for his words."</p>

<p>"The cunning old fox," said Felise to herself, while she drew
her black brows angrily together. "Already he has been trying
to find the way to her heart."</p>

<p>"He is rather fine-looking for one who is certainly no longer
young&mdash;don't you think so, Bonnibel?" pursued the wily girl.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Bonnibel, willing to praise Colonel Carlyle
because she thought it would please Felise; "he does not seem so
very old, and he is quite handsome and stately-looking."</p>

<p>Whatever Felise might have replied to this was interrupted by
the entrance of Lucy, Bonnibel's maid. A broad smile lighted
her comely, good-natured features at the sight of the visitor.</p>

<p>"For you, miss," said she, going up to Bonnibel and putting
in her hand a small volume of splendidly-bound poems and a
rare hot-house bouquet, whose fragrance filled the room, and
turning to Miss Herbert she added: "Colonel Carlyle is waiting
in the drawing-room, Miss Herbert."</p>

<p>Felise made no answer to the maid. She swept forward and
looked at the flowers in Bonnibel's hand.</p>

<p>It was a lovely bouquet, composed almost entirely of white
flowers. A lily filled the center, surrounded by exquisite rose-buds
and waxen tube-roses and azalias. The border of the lovely
floral tribute was a delicate fringe of blue forget-me-nots. On a
small white card depending from the bouquet was written these
words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Miss Vere</span>, with the compliments of the day from her father's
friend."</p>

<p>"Her father's friend," said Felise, reading it aloud. "That
must mean Colonel Carlyle."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Bonnibel, simply. "He is very kind to
remember me to-day. You will thank him for me, Felise."</p>

<p>"Certainly," Felise answered.</p>

<p>She took up the book&mdash;a handsome copy of one of the modern
poets&mdash;and glanced rapidly through it, but found no writing or
underscoring within it, as her jealous fancy had expected.</p>

<p>"I must go," she said, putting it down and trailing her silken
skirts hurriedly from the room.</p>

<p>Lucy looked after her with a slight smile. She, in common
with all the domestics, hated the overbearing Felise and it
pleased her to see what her innocent young mistress never
dreamed of&mdash;that Mrs. Arnold's daughter was furiously jealous
and angry because of her suitor's tribute to Bonnibel.</p>

<p>The colonel's tribute to Miss Herbert was a much more pretentious
one than that which had been the cause of arousing her
jealousy up-stairs. He brought her a bracelet of gold, set with
glowing rubies, and a bouquet that was a perfect triumph of the
floral art. Its central flower was a white japonica, and sprigs of
scarlet salvia blazed around it; but Felise remembered the modest
white lily up-stairs, with its suggestive circle of forget-me-nots,
and her eyes blazed with scarcely concealed anger as she thanked
the colonel for his gifts.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle was in brilliant spirits to-day. Always a fine
talker, he surpassed himself on this occasion, and the guests exchanged
significant glances, thinking that surely he had proposed
to Miss Herbert and been accepted, for she, too, appeared more
fascinating than usual, and exerted herself to please her elderly
suitor. She had laid aside the more cumbrous appendages of
mourning, such as crape and bombazine, and appeared in a handsome
black silk, with filmy white laces at throat and wrists. A
single spray of the scarlet salvia, carelessly broken and fastened
in her dark hair, brightened her whole appearance, and made
her creamy, olive complexion beautiful by the contrast. She
was looking her best, as she wanted to do, for she felt that she
was about to lose her slight hold upon the millionaire's heart
and she meant to do her best to win back her lost ground.</p>

<p>Alas for Felise's prospects! A pair of tearful, violet eyes, a
little, white face, a quivering baby mouth, drawn with pain, had
totally obscured the image of her bright, dark beauty in the
colonel's heart. He was as foolishly in love with Bonnibel's
dainty loveliness as any boy of twenty, and through all his brilliant
talk to-day his heart was bounding with the thought of her,
and he was revolving plans in his mind to free himself from what
had almost become an entanglement with Miss Herbert, that he
might spread his net to catch the beautiful little white dove that
had fluttered across his path.</p>

<p>"Miss Vere is better, I trust," he found courage to ask of Mrs.
Arnold before he left that evening. His guilty conscience made
him shrink from asking Felise even that simple question. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
knew that he had paid her sufficient attention to warrant her in
expecting a proposal, and now he began to feel just a little afraid
of the flash of her great dark eyes.</p>

<p>"She is better," Mrs. Arnold answered, coldly; "but not able
to leave her sofa. Doctor Graham thinks it will be several weeks
before she is well."</p>

<p>"So," the enamored colonel thought to himself, "it will be
several weeks before I can see her again. That seems like an
eternity."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Italia, oh, Italia, thou who hast<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fatal gift of beauty: which became<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A funeral dower of present woes and past,'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>repeated the voice of a young man leaning from an upper
window, and looking down upon the antique streets of famous
Rome.</p>

<p>"I think you have more taste for poetry than painting, Carl,"
said a second voice.</p>

<p>The scene is an artist's studio, up four flights of stairs, and
very near the sky. A large skylight gives admission to the clear
and radiant light, and the windows are open for the soft breeze
to enter the room, though it is the month of December in that
fair Italian clime, where it is always summer. Pictures and
palettes, statuettes and bronzes adorn the walls, and somewhat
litter the room, and its only two occupants wear artists' blouses,
though one of the wearers sits idly at the window gazing down
into the street. He is blonde and stout, with gay blue eyes, and
is unmistakably German, while his darker companion, who is
busily painting away at a picture, is just as certainly an American.
They both bear their nationalities plainly in their faces.</p>

<p>"Poetry and painting are sister arts, I think," said Carl Muller,
laughing. "The poets paint with words as we do with colors.
They have the advantage of us poor devils, for their word-paintings
remain beautiful forever, while our ochres crack and
our crimsons fade."</p>

<p>"You should turn poet, then, Carl."</p>

<p>"I had some thought of it once," said the mercurial Carl,
laughing, "but upon making trial of my powers, I found that
I lacked the divine afflatus."</p>

<p>"Say rather that you lacked the more prosaic attribute that
you lack in painting&mdash;<i>industry</i>," said the American.</p>

<p>"Whatever failing I may have in this respect is fully atoned for
by you, Leslie. Never saw I a poor dauber so deeply wedded to
his art. Your perseverance is simply marvelous."</p>

<p>"It is the only way to conquer fame, Carl. There is no royal
road to success," said the artist, painting busily away as he
talked.</p>

<p>Carl yawned lazily and repeated Beattie's well-known lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Ah! who can tell how hard it is to climb<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The steep where Fame's proud temple shines afar;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah! who can tell how many a soul sublime,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Has felt the influence of malignant star,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And waged with fortune an eternal war!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The 'malignant star' in your case means <i>idleness</i>, Carl. You
have talent enough if you would but apply yourself. Up, up,
man, and get to your work."</p>

<p>"It is impossible to conquer my constitutional inertia this
evening, Leslie. To-morrow I will vie with you in perseverance
and labor like a galley-slave," laughed the German, stretching
his lazy length out of the window.</p>

<p>There was silence a few moments. Carl was absorbed in something
going on in the street below&mdash;perhaps a street fight between
two fiery Italians, or perhaps the more interesting sight of some
pretty woman going to mass or confession&mdash;while Leslie Dane's
brush moved on unweariedly over his task. Evidently it was a
labor of love.</p>

<p>"I should like to know where you get your models, Leslie,"
said Carl Muller, looking back into the room. "You do not have
the Italian type of women in your faces. What do you copy
from?"</p>

<p>"Memory," said the artist, laconically.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you know a woman anywhere half
as beautiful as the women you put on your canvas?"</p>

<p>"I know one so transcendently lovely that the half of her
beauty can never be transferred to canvas," said Leslie Dane,
while a flush of pride rose over his features.</p>

<p>"In America?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"In America," answered Leslie.</p>

<p>"Whew!" said the German, comprehensively. "I thought
you did not care for women, Mr. Dane."</p>

<p>"I never said so, Carl," said Leslie Dane, smiling.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;but actions speak louder than words. You avoid
them, you decline invitations where you are likely to meet them,
and the handsome models vote you a perfect bear."</p>

<p>"Because there is but one woman in the whole world to me,"
answered Leslie Dane, and he paused a moment in his painting,
and looked away with a world of tenderness in his large, dark
eyes.</p>

<p>Carl Muller began to look interested.</p>

<p>"Ah! now I see why you work so hard," he said. "There is a
woman at the bottom of it. There is always a woman at the
bottom of everything that goes on in this world whether it be
good or evil."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," said Leslie, resuming his work with a
sigh to the memory of the absent girl he loved.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For love is heaven, and heaven is love,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>hummed Carl in his rich tenor voice.</p>

<p>"Leslie, you will accompany me to the <i>fete</i> to-night?" said he,
presently.</p>

<p>"Thank you. I do not care to go," said Leslie.</p>

<p>"Heavens, what a selfish fellow!" said Carl, turning back to
the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Silence fell between them again. The soft breeze came sighing
in at the window ruffling Carl's sunny curls and caressing Leslie
Dane's cheek with viewless fingers.</p>

<p>A pot of violets on the window ledge filled the air with delicate
perfume. After that evening the scent of violets always came to
Leslie Dane wedded to a painful memory.</p>

<p>There was a heavy step at the door. Their portly landlady
pushed her head into the room.</p>

<p>"Letters, gentlemen," she said.</p>

<p>Carl Muller sprang up with alacrity.</p>

<p>"All for me, of course," he said. "Nobody ever writes to
Dane."</p>

<p>He took the packet and went back to his seat, while his companion,
with a smothered sigh, went on with his work. It was
quite true that no one ever wrote to him, yet he still kept waiting
and hoping for one dear letter that never&mdash;never came.</p>

<p>"Ah, by Jove! but I was mistaken," Carl broke out suddenly.
"Hurrah, Leslie, here's a love letter from the girl you left behind
you."</p>

<p>He held up a little creamy-hued envelope, smooth and thick as
satin, addressed in a lady's elegant hand, and Leslie Dane caught
it almost rudely from him. Carl gave a significant whistle and
returned to his own correspondence.</p>

<p>Leslie Dane tore open the letter so long waited and hoped for,
and devoured its contents with passionate impatience. It was
very brief. Let us glance over his shoulder and read what was
written there:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Leslie</span>," she wrote, "your letters have kept coming and
coming, and every one has been like a stab to my heart. I pray you
never to write to me again, for I have repented in bitterness of
spirit the blind folly into which you led me that night. Oh, how
could you do it? I was but a child. I did not know what love
meant, and I was bewildered and carried away by your handsome
face, and the romance of that moonlight flitting. It was
wicked, it was cruel, Leslie, to bind me so, for, oh, God, I <i>love</i>
another now, and I never can be his! But at least I will <i>never</i>
be yours. I have burned your letters, and I shall hate your
memory as long I live for the cruel wrong you did me. God forgive
you, for I never can!</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bonnibel.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Leslie Dane threw that dreadful letter down and ground it beneath
his heel as though it had been a deadly serpent. It was,
for it had stung him to the heart.</p>

<p>Carl Muller looked up at the strange sound of that grinding
boot-heel, and saw his friend standing fixedly staring, into vacancy,
his dark eyes blazing like coals of fire, his handsome face
pallid as death, and set in a tense look of awful despair and bitterness
terrible to behold.</p>

<p>Carl Muller sprang up and shook him violently by the arm.</p>

<p>"My God! Leslie," he cried, "what is it? What has happened
to move you so? Is there anyone dead?"</p>

<p>The handsome artist did not seem to hear him. He stood immovable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
save for the horrid crunching of his boot-heel as it
ground that fatal letter into fragments.</p>

<p>"Leslie," exclaimed Carl, "speak, for mercy's sake! You cannot
imagine how horrible you look!"</p>

<p>Thus adjured Leslie Dane shook off his friend's clasp roughly,
and strode across the room to a recess where a veiled picture
hung against the wall.</p>

<p>He had always refused to show it to his brother artist, but now
he pushed the covering aside, disclosing a female head surrounded
by silvery clouds like that of an angel. The face, framed
in waving masses of golden hair, was lighted by eyes of tender
violet, and radiantly beautiful.</p>

<p>"Look Carl," said the artist in a changed and hollow voice,
"is not that the face of an angel?"</p>

<p>Carl Muller looked at the lovely face in wonder and delight.</p>

<p>"Beautiful, beautiful!" he exclaimed, "it is the face of a
seraph!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is the face of a seraph," repeated Leslie Dane. "The
face of a seraph, but oh, God, she is <i>fickle</i>, <i>faithless</i>, <i>false</i>!"</p>

<p>He stood still a moment looking at the fair young face smiling
on him in its radiant beauty, then caught up his brush and swept
it across the canvas.</p>

<p>One touch, the tender blue eyes were obliterated, another,
and the curved red lips were gone with their loving smile, another
and another, and the whole angelic vision was blotted from
the canvas forever.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p>"No, don't attempt to excuse yourself, mother! If you had
taken my advice, and turned your wax doll out upon the world
to look out for herself, this would never have happened! But no,
you must saddle yourself with the charge of her, and pamper her
as foolishly as her uncle did! And now you see the result of your
blind folly. It needed but one sight of her baby-face by that old
dotard to ruin my prospects for life. I hope you are satisfied
with your work!"</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock at night, and Felise Herbert had come into
her mother's room in her dressing-gown, with her dark hair
hanging over her shoulders, and her eyes flashing angrily, to upbraid
her mother for her weakness in the matter of Bonnibel
Vere.</p>

<p>"You should have turned her adrift upon the world," she repeated,
stamping her slippered foot angrily. "She might have
starved to death for all I cared! <i>After all I did for you</i>, I think
you could have done that much to please <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"But, Felise, you know it was quite impossible to take such extreme
measures without incurring the censure of the world, and
perhaps its suspicion!" said Mrs. Arnold, deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"Who cares for suspicion&mdash;they could not prove anything!"
said Felise, snapping her fingers.</p>

<p>"No, perhaps not," Mrs. Arnold answered, "but all the same,
I should not like to run the risk. You are blinded by anger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Felise; or you would reason more clearly. You know I did not
want to keep the girl here. I hate her as much as you do. I
have hated her ever since she was born, but you know I dare
not turn her off. Society would taboo us if we dared hint such a
thing. Turn a girl of her aristocratic antecedents out upon the
world to earn her living, while I am rolling in wealth! A girl
who knows no more of the world than a baby! The daughter of
General Vere, the niece of my dead husband! Felise, you must
see that it would never do!"</p>

<p>"It would if I had been suffered to have my way," answered
the girl, marching angrily up and down the floor. "To be
thwarted this way in my prospect of making the most brilliant
match of the season is too bad! It is shameful! For her to step
into my place this way makes me hate her worse than ever!"</p>

<p>"But, Felise, she <i>cannot</i> step into your place, my dear. Did
you not tell me you had learned from Leslie Dane's intercepted
letters that the girl was secretly married to him? Why did you
meddle with their correspondence, anyway? Why not have let
him come back in time to claim her? She would then have been
out of your way!"</p>

<p>"Mother, you talk like a fool!" exclaimed the daughter, angrily.
"You know I dare not let Leslie Dane return here! I am
compelled to keep him out of the country for the sake of my own
safety. I am compelled to separate the two because he must not
hear of the charge of murder that we made against him. If she
should hear it, as she is likely to do at any time, and should communicate
it to him, what would be the consequence? He would
return here and disprove the charge at once. Bonnibel was with
him that night. They went to Brandon and were married while
your husband was being mur&mdash;&mdash; put out of the way. He could
prove an <i>alibi</i> at once. You talk of suspicion&mdash;where would suspicion
fall then?"</p>

<p>"Surely not on us, Felise!" said Mrs. Arnold, fearfully.</p>

<p>"And why not?" sneered the girl. "If the now quiescent subject
were agitated again what absurd theories might not be propounded
by the suspicious world? Who can tell whether Wild
Madge could keep the secret? I tell you I have only consulted
our vital interests in separating Leslie Dane and Bonnibel Vere,
though to do so I have had to destroy my every prospect of becoming
the millionaire's wife. I am compelled to keep that beggarly
artist out of the country at any cost."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, there is no chance of Bonnibel marrying Colonel
Carlyle even though she should be separated forever from
her artist-husband, for she is a married woman anyhow. One
hint of this to Colonel Carlyle would make your affair all right
with him again!"</p>

<p>"It would not," answered Felise, passionately. "He is madly
in love with her. Have I not seen it in these few weeks since she
has been well enough to come down-stairs? Has not the old fool
hung over her as dotingly as any boy-lover could do? Suppose I
told him the truth? Do you think he would return to me? No,
he would only hate me because I had shattered his brilliant air
castle!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am surprised that Bonnibel tolerates his attentions as she
does," said Mrs. Arnold, stirring up the fire that was beginning
to burn low in the grate.</p>

<p>"She does not suspect what the old fox is after; I will do her
that much justice," said Felise, bitterly. "He is very cautious.
He has a thousand tales of her father's prowess with which to
pave his way and awaken her interest. She makes an idol of her
wretched father who squandered every penny of her mother's
fortune, and only redeemed himself by dying recklessly in some
foolish charge on the battle-field!"</p>

<p>She resumed her walk up and down the floor which she had
temporarily ceased during the last outburst. She was furiously
angry.</p>

<p>Her eyes blazed luridly, her lips were curled back from her
glittering teeth, her step seemed to spurn the floor. Her mother
watched her uneasily.</p>

<p>"Felise, do you not fret yourself, my dear. I am persuaded
that everything will come right soon. Suppose Colonel Carlyle
is in love with Bonnibel. If he proposes to her she is compelled
to refuse his offer. What more natural than that he should return
to you then, and make you his wife. Hearts are often
caught on the rebound, you know."</p>

<p>"Mother, hush! You talk like a simpleton as you are!" was
the fierce retort.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold was stung to anger by the unprovoked insolence
of her daughter. She rose and looked at her in dignified displeasure.</p>

<p>"Felise," she said, threateningly, "you are my daughter, but
you must not suppose that I will tamely bear the continued disrespect
and contumely I have lately been forced to receive at
your hands. In your rage at losing Colonel Carlyle you seem
to forget that it is in my power to make you almost as wealthy
as he could do. Remember, I am a very rich woman, and I can
leave my wealth to whom I please."</p>

<p>"And who placed you in that position?" sneered Felise. "How
much would you have been worth but for my constant care of
your interests? A third of your husband's property, which was all
you could legally claim! That was what he said to his big wax-doll.
The balance of his money was for her, to make her a queen
and win the homage of the world for her. Perhaps you will leave
her the money I have risked so much to gain for you?"</p>

<p>"Felise, this is but idle recrimination. You know I would not
leave Bonnibel Vere a penny to save her soul from perdition, and
you know I have been scheming all my life to get that money for
you, and that I will certainly give it to you. But I do not understand
your mood to-night. What is it that you wish me to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing! Months ago I begged you to send the
girl away and you refused me. You knew I hated her, and you
knew I spared nothing that came in my way. She has come
between me and my dearest ambition. Now let her look to herself.
I tell you, mother, I will take a <i>terrible revenge</i> on Bonnibel
Vere for what I have lost. <i>I have sworn it, and I will surely keep my
vow!</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>She stood still a moment with upraised hands, looking fixedly
at her mother, then she turned and went swiftly from the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold stared after her blankly. She was a cruel and
wicked woman, but she would not have dared to go such lengths
as her daughter. She was afraid of her daughter, and frightened
at the terrible intent expressed in her tone and manner.</p>

<p>"My God!" she murmured, with a shiver, "what rash act is
she about to commit?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>Colonel Carlyle was as deeply infatuated with Bonnibel
Vere as the jealous Felise had declared him to be; but, as she had
always asserted, he was very wily and cautious in his advances.
He was afraid of frightening the pretty bird he wished to ensnare.
He, therefore, adopted a deportment of almost fatherly
tenderness toward her that was very pleasant to the lonely girl,
who missed her uncle's protecting care so much, and who also
began to perceive in Mrs. Arnold and her daughter a changed
manner, which, while it could scarcely be colder than usual, was
tinged with an indefinable shade of insolence.</p>

<p>Poor, pretty Bonnibel! she had fallen upon dark days. She
had been deceived by Mrs. Arnold's protestations at first, but by
degrees a new light began to break upon her. Mrs. Arnold began
to practice a degree of parsimony toward her that was bewildering
to the girl. She withdrew Bonnibel's allowance of
money, and at last the girl found her dainty little purse quite
empty, and likely to remain so&mdash;a thing that had never happened
to her before in the course of her life, for her uncle had been lavishly
generous to her in respect to pin-money. Her supply of
mourning was extremely limited, and but for her quiet mode of
life would have been quite inadequate to her needs.</p>

<p>But if Mrs. Arnold had wished to diminish Bonnibel's beauty
by giving it so meager a setting she failed in the endeavor. The
jewel was too bright to miss extraneous adornment.</p>

<p>The somber black dresses could not dim the gleam of her golden
hair, the sparkle of her sea-blue eyes. Her white brow and throat
were like the petals of a lily, and with returning health a lovely
rose-tint began to flush her cheeks.</p>

<p>Her beauty was a royal dower of which no spite or malignity
could deprive her. Clothed upon with sackcloth she would still
have remained,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A daughter of the gods, divinely tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And most divinely fair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Bonnibel knew that she was beautiful. She had heard it remarked
so often that she could not be ignorant of the fact.</p>

<p>In those past happy days that now seemed so far away she had
taken a childish, innocent pride in the knowledge. But now in
her trouble and loneliness she had forgotten it, or cared for it no
more. So it never occurred to her to ascribe the painful change
in her aunt and Felise to the fact that was quite obvious to
others&mdash;the very plain fact that she had unconsciously rivaled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Felise with Colonel Carlyle and that he only waited a proper season
to declare himself.</p>

<p>There was none of the dawdling and hesitation now that had
marked his courtship of Felise and prevented him from making
the important declaration she had schemed and toiled for. He
had virtually jilted Felise, for he had done everything but speak
the important words, but the proud girl bore his desertion in
ominous silence that boded no good to the man who had thus
wronged her.</p>

<p>Lucy and Janet, the respective maids of the two young ladies,
held many a whispered colloquy over Colonel Carlyle's defection.
Janet indeed was an object of sympathy in those days,
for she had to bear the brunt of Felise's anger, which was no
slight thing to endure. Indeed, it is probable that the much-enduring
maid would have given warning on the spot had it not
been for an <i>affaire du c&oelig;ur</i> which she was carrying out with the
footman.</p>

<p>Rather than be separated from this object of her fond affections
Janet remained in Felise's service and endured her caprices
and ill-treatment with that heroic fortitude with which
women from time immemorial have borne slight and wrong for
love's sake.</p>

<p>"Will Miss Bonnibel marry him, do you think, Lucy?" asked
Janet at one of their solemn conclaves.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Lucy answered. "Seems to me the child
don't have the least idea of what is going on right afore her eyes.
I don't believe she knows that the colonel is a courtin' her! She
thinks he is a friend, like, and because he knew her father in the
army and talks a good deal about his bravery, she listens to him
and never dreams that she has cut Miss Felise out right afore her
face."</p>

<p>"And serves her right, too," said Janet, heartily, taking a
malicious pleasure in the defeat of her over-bearing mistress; "I,
for one, am downright glad that she has cut my lady out of her
rich beau! It would be a fine match for Miss Bonnibel since her
uncle has left her without a cent."</p>

<p>"I hope she will marry him," said Lucy. "Things isn't going
at all to my notion in this house, Janet. Sour looks and impident
words is flung around altogether too free in my young lady's
hearing. And she getting that shabby that she have got but one
decent mourning gown to her back, and I hear nothing said of a
new one! As for money I don't believe Mrs. Arnold has given
her a single penny since her uncle died; I've seen her little purse
and it's quite empty. I'd have put a few of my own savings into
it, only I was afraid she might be angry."</p>

<p>"I hope she'll marry Carlyle and queen it over them both,"
said Janet. "I tell you, Lucy, it was very strange that Mr.
Arnold's <i>will</i> wasn't found. I am quite sure he made one&mdash;he
wouldn't have slighted your young lady intentionally. He loved
that pretty little blue-eyed girl as the apple of his eye, and
there was small love lost between him and t'other one. 'Twas
mysterious the way things turned out at his death, Lucy."</p>

<p>"Aye, it were," assented Lucy; "I heard Miss Bonnibel, myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
tell Mrs. Arnold down at Sea View when she were sick, that
her uncle told her he had made a will and provided liberally
for her. And Mrs. Arnold laughed at her and pretended that the
fever hadn't got out of her head yet. <i>She</i> didn't want to believe
there was a will, Janet, <i>she</i> didn't! Now I ask you, Janet, what
has become of that there will?"</p>

<p>Janet laughed scornfully and significantly.</p>

<p>"Ah! it's gone where Miss Bonnibel's blue eyes will never shine
on it," said she. "It'll never see the light of day again. All that
she can do is to marry Colonel Carlyle and get even with them
all."</p>

<p>"I wish she would," sighed Lucy; "but I don't believe she will.
They said she was in love with a young artist last summer, and
that her uncle drove him away&mdash;the same young man they laid
the murder on, you know."</p>

<p>"Do you believe he did it, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"Not I," said Lucy, with a scornful sniff. "I'd sooner believe
<i>they</i> did it between themselves! I've seen the young man when
he used to come visiting the master at Sea View. A handsome
young man he was, and that soft-spoken he would not hurt a fly,
I know. But he was poor and made his living by drawing pictures,
and since Miss Bonnibel is poor, too, now, I'd rather she'd
marry that rich old man, for, poor dear, what good could <i>she</i> do
as a poor man's wife!"</p>

<p>"Has she forgotten the young feller, do you think?" inquired
Janet, thinking of her own "young feller" below stairs with a
thrill of romantic sympathy for Miss Vere's love affair.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, <i>no</i>, and never <i>will</i>," said Lucy, confidently. "She
never names him; but I know she's been grieved and unhappy
over and above what natural grief for Mr. Arnold could amount
to. But I doubt it's all over between them. He's been in hiding,
of course, somewhere, ever since they accused him of the murder,
and I doubt if Miss Bonnibel ever sets her sweet blue eyes on
his handsome face again."</p>

<p>"If he's not guilty why don't he come out and prove his innocence?"
exclaimed the romantic Janet. "What a fine scene there
would be&mdash;Miss Bonnibel all in smiles and tears of joy, and t'other
ones scowling and angry at them two lovers."</p>

<p>"Ah! I can't tell you <i>why</i> he doesn't do so," answered Lucy,
sighing; "but there must be some good reason for't. No one
could get me to believe that Mr. Dane did that wicked and cruel
murder! My young mistress, so innocent as she is herself, could
never have loved a man that was mean enough to do that deed!"</p>

<p>The loud peal of Miss Herbert's dressing-room bell resounding
through the house broke up the conference between the maids,
and Janet went away to answer it, muttering, angrily:</p>

<p>"Lucy, I do wish we could change mistresses for awhile. I'm
that tired with tramping up and down to wait on that ill-natered
upstart that all my bones are sore."</p>

<p>So Bonnibel's circumstances and prospects were discussed in
high life up-stairs, and by servantdom down-stairs, while she herself,
the most interested party, was ignorant of it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>How could she, whose torn heart was filled with one single
aching memory, take note of all that went on about her?</p>

<p>She was still living in the past, and took small heed of the
present. She thought Colonel Carlyle was still fond of Felise,
and that his little kindnesses and attention to her were offered
to her for her father's sake. She felt grateful to him, but that
was all. She was not pleased when he came, nor sorry when he
went. So, when the long, cold days of winter wore away and
nature began to smile with the coming of a genial spring, and
Colonel Carlyle could restrain his impatient ardor no longer, his
proposal of marriage, worded with all the passion of a younger
lover, came upon her with the suddenness of a thunderbolt from
a clear sky.</p>

<p>"Surely, Mr. Carlyle, I have misunderstood your meaning,"
she said, looking up at him when he ceased to speak, with terror
and fright in her large eyes. "You asked me to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To <i>marry</i> me," said the colonel. "You have not misunderstood
me, Bonnibel. I love you, my darling, as passionately as
any young man could do. I ask you to give yourself to me for
my cherished wife. It would be the sole aim of my life to make
you happy. Will you be my wife, little darling?"</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;you are engaged to Miss Herbert," said Bonnibel,
in surprise and reproach.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, my dear. I am not. I admire and esteem
Miss Herbert very much, but I have never addressed a word of
love to her. It is <i>you</i> whom I love&mdash;<i>you</i> whom I wish to make
my wife," exclaimed the ardent colonel.</p>

<p>"I certainly understood that you would marry Felise," answered
Bonnibel, gravely.</p>

<p>"It was a very serious error on your part, my dear little girl,
for I have been trying all the winter to make you see that I loved
no one but <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"I never dreamed of such a thing," exclaimed the girl, in a
tone of genuine distress.</p>

<p>"Then you are the only one who did not suspect it," said he, in
a mortified tone. "The fact was very patent to all others."</p>

<p>Bonnibel looked down at the shimmering opal on her finger,
and a blush of shame rose over her delicate features. She thought
to herself, impulsively:</p>

<p>"This is dreadful for me&mdash;a wedded wife&mdash;to sit here and listen
to such words without the power of protesting against them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you think I am too old for you, my angel," said the
colonel, breaking the silence; "but my heart and my feelings are
much younger than my years. I could not have loved you more
ardently thirty years ago. But if age is a fault in your eyes, my
darling, I will atone for it by every indulgence on earth, and by
a deathless devotion."</p>

<p>"Oh, pray, do not say another word, Colonel Carlyle. It can
never be, sir. I can never be your wife!" exclaimed the girl, in
deep agitation.</p>

<p>"But why not, my dearest girl?"</p>

<p>"I do not love you, sir," said the girl, cresting her graceful head
half-haughtily upon her slender throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will teach you to love me, darling. Come, say that you will
let me take you away from this house, where I can see that they
hate you, and make your life more happy. I will do anything to
further your happiness, Bonnibel," urged the colonel.</p>

<p>"What you wish is quite impossible, sir. I beg that you will
dismiss the subject, my dear, kind friend, and forget it," repeated
Bonnibel, earnestly.</p>

<p>"I will not take <i>no</i> for an answer," replied the colonel, obdurately.
"I have taken you by surprise, and you do not know
your own mind, my dear little girl. I will give you a week
to decide in. Think of all the advantages I can offer you, Bonnibel,
and of my devoted love, and say <i>yes</i> when I come back for
your answer."</p>

<p>So saying he abruptly took his leave.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p>"Mother, Bonnibel has refused Colonel Carlyle."</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold looked up from the sofa where she lay reading a
novel by the gas-light with a start of surprise. Felise had come
into the room as quietly as a spirit in her white dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"Mercy, Felise, how you startled me!" she exclaimed. "I had
just got to such an exciting part where the heroine was just
about to be murdered by her jealous rival when in you came with
your long hair and trailing white wrapper, like Lady Macbeth
walking in her sleep. I almost expected to hear you exclaim:</p>

<p>"'Here's the smell of the blood still; all the perfumes of Arabia
will not sweeten this little hand!'"</p>

<p>"You are quite dramatic to-night, mother&mdash;your novel must
be an exciting one," said Felise, with a slight sneer. She came
forward and sat down in a large easy-chair opposite her mother.
She looked pale, and her eyes burned with repressed excitement.</p>

<p>"It is," said Mrs. Arnold, "the most thrilling book I have
read lately. But what were you saying when you came in and
frightened me so?"</p>

<p>"I said that Bonnibel had <i>refused</i> Colonel Carlyle," repeated
Felise, distinctly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold sat up with her fingers between the pages of her
book, whose interesting perusal she felt loth to stop. She said,
half stupidly:</p>

<p>"Oh, she has, has she? Well, it had to come to that, sooner or
later, you know, my love."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" answered Felise, shortly.</p>

<p>"Well, you know we have been expecting it some time, Felise,
ever since Colonel Carlyle lost his heart about her. I must say
his conduct to you has not been that of a gentleman, my dear."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," said Felise dryly.</p>

<p>She was very quiet, but her small hands were tightly clenched.
She seemed "to hold passion in a leash" by a strong effort of will.</p>

<p>"But how did you find it out?" inquired her mother, thinking
that Felise was taking it quite calmly, after all.</p>

<p>"As I find out most things&mdash;by keeping my eyes and ears
open!" retorted her daughter, tartly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"When did it happen?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon, while you were out calling on the Trevertons."</p>

<p>"Was the old fool much cut up about it?" inquired Mrs. Arnold,
inelegantly.</p>

<p>"He would not take <i>no</i> for an answer," said Felise. "He
wanted her to take time to think of all the advantages he offered
her, and he is coming in a week to hear her decision."</p>

<p>"The silly old dotard!" ejaculated her mother. "Well, all he
can get by his persistence is a second refusal."</p>

<p>Felise Herbert straightened herself in her chair, and looked at
her mother with a strange smile on her face.</p>

<p>"I do not intend that he shall get a <i>second refusal</i>!" she said, in
a low voice that was very firm and incisive.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold stared at her daughter in blank surprise and incredulity.</p>

<p>"Why, Felise, what can you mean?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"I mean that Bonnibel Vere shall marry Colonel Carlyle!" her
daughter answered, in the same low, determined voice.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, you know it cannot be when she already has
a <i>husband</i>! Besides, I did not know that you wanted them to
marry. I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;" said Mrs. Arnold, stopping
short because surprise had overpowered her.</p>

<p>She looked at the white figure sitting so quietly there in the
arm-chair, with some apprehension. Had Felise's disappointment
impaired her reason?</p>

<p>"You need not look at me so strangely, mother," said Felise.
"I assure you I am not mad, as your eyes imply. I am as sane
as you are; but I have said that Bonnibel Vere shall marry my
recreant lover, and I mean to keep my word. She has stolen
him from me, and now she shall marry him and get out of my
way! Or perhaps you would prefer to keep her here to spoil the
next eligible chance I get," said Felise, looking at her mother
with burning eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can bring her to consent to such a thing,
even if you are in earnest, my dear."</p>

<p>"You have got to help me, mother. You shall tell her that
you will not allow her to refuse Colonel Carlyle&mdash;that she shall
become his wife, and that if she does not revoke her rejection,
you will turn her instantly into the street!"</p>

<p>"Felise, will you tell me why you are so determined upon
their marriage? I supposed you were unwilling to it&mdash;it would
be only natural for you to oppose it&mdash;but you seem as anxious
for it as Colonel Carlyle himself. Again, I ask you why?</p>

<p>"Mother, I told you I would take revenge upon my rival.
This is a part of my revenge. Their marriage will be
the first act in the drama. Do not ask me how I am going to
proceed. Let me work out my revenge in my own way. I owe
them both a score. Never fear but I will pay it off with interest!"</p>

<p>"But, Felise, you must know that Bonnibel would sooner declare
her secret marriage than be forced into another one. I can
turn her into the street if you are determined upon it; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
know I cannot make a girl as truthful and pure as Bonnibel Vere
knowingly become the wife of two husbands."</p>

<p>"I fully admit your inability to do that, mother. I do not
intend to insist on your performance of impossibilities. As for
Leslie Dane, look here!"'</p>

<p>She straightened out a folded paper she had carried in her
bosom, and leaning forward pointed out a small paragraph to
her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold read the brief paragraph with starting eyes, then
turned and looked at her daughter. She no longer kept her
finger between the pages of her novel. It had slipped down
upon the floor. She was getting absorbed in this tragedy in real
life.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" she exclaimed. "Felise, can it be true?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" was the cool interrogatory. "Such things happen
often&mdash;don't they?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Every minute dies a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Every minute one is born.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Let me see the date," Mrs. Arnold said, bending forward.
"Ah! it is very recent. Well, I <i>am</i> surprised. But yet it is a
very fortunate occurrence, is it not? Of course it is genuine."</p>

<p>"Why, of course it is," said Felise, with a short, dry laugh.
"How else could it be in the paper? They don't put such things
in for sport, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Of course not; but it came upon me so suddenly I felt quite
incredulous at first. Well, this puts a new face upon the matter,
does it not, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, mother. I will show her this paper, and she cannot
have any pretext for repeating her refusal in the face of the
alternative with which you shall threaten her. I suppose any
girl in her senses would marry Colonel Carlyle and his millions
rather than be turned out homeless into the street."</p>

<p>She sat still a moment staring before her into futurity with
lurid eyes that saw her revenge already, and curling lips that
began to taste its sweetness in anticipation.</p>

<p>"When must I tell her, Felise?" inquired Mrs. Arnold.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, mother. There is no use in delaying matters.
Let us bring the marriage about as speedily as possible. You
will tell her to-morrow what she has to do, and I will be on
hand with the paper."</p>

<p>She rose slowly.</p>

<p>"Well, I will go, and leave you to finish your novel," she
said; "but if you take my advice you will retire instead. It is
growing late. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night, my love, and pleasant dreams," her mother
answered.</p>

<p>She went out as quietly as she had entered, her dark hair flying
wildly over her shoulders and her white robes trailing noiselessly
after her. She was twisting her hands together, and
again Mrs. Arnold thought of Lady Macbeth washing her hands
and crying in her sleep, "Out, damned spot!"</p>

<p>Ah, Felise Herbert! There was a stain on your soul as red
as that on Lady Macbeth's hand!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p>The morning after the rejection of Colonel Carlyle, Bonnibel
Vere sat alone in a pleasant little morning-room that was thrown
out from the main residence as a wing. It was daintily furnished
in blue plush and walnut, and had double glass doors that looked
out upon a lovely little garden that in this pleasant May season
was glowing with bloom and fragrance.</p>

<p>Bonnibel had been trying to read, but in the perturbed state of
her mind she could not fix her attention upon the book. It had
fallen from her lap upon the floor, and as she sat in the luxurious
arm-chair she leaned forward with her little chin buried in one
pink palm and her blue eyes gazing into vacancy, as if lost in
thought.</p>

<p>She looked very fair and sweet sitting there in a cool, white
morning-dress, trimmed in lace and dotted about with several
bows of black ribbon. Her beautiful hair, which was growing
long and thick again, fell upon her shoulders in loose curls, like
glints of sunshine.</p>

<p>She had broken a spray of white hyacinth and pinned it on
her bosom, and she looked as pure and sweet as the flower
itself.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she was thinking to herself, "that I was so
unfortunate as to win Colonel Carlyle's affection. I certainly never
dreamed of such a thing, and a year ago I should have laughed in
the face of any old man who dared propose to me, and have told
him I did not wish to marry my grandfather. Heigh-ho! I have
grown graver now, and do not turn everything into a jest as I
did then. Still, I wish it had not happened. I liked him simply
as my father's friend, and I thought he liked me just as papa's
daughter."</p>

<p>She sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"I think I understand some things now that have puzzled me
all the winter," she mused. "He was Felise's lover when I first
came, and I have unconsciously rivaled her. She hates me for it,
and Aunt Arnold hates me, too. Ah! if they knew all that I
knew they need not be afraid. Felise is welcome to him, and I
will try to induce him to return to her. I never thought that
Colonel Carlyle could have acted so basely toward her, as it seems
he has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold's sudden entrance into the room interrupted her
meditations. She looked so angry and overbearing that Bonnibel
rose and was about leaving the room when she was recalled
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Stay, Bonnibel; I wish to speak with you. Resume your seat,
if you please."</p>

<p>Flushing with resentment at the insolent authority of the tone,
Bonnibel turned and faced the lady with a gleam of pride shining
in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," she answered, coldly. "I will hear what you have
to say standing."</p>

<p>"As you please," said Mrs. Arnold, with a sneer. "Perhaps your
strength may not stand the ordeal, however."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Bonnibel stared at her in silent surprise.</p>

<p>"You have refused an offer of marriage from Colonel Carlyle,"
said Mrs. Arnold in a tone of deep displeasure.</p>

<p>Bonnibel's fair cheeks deepened their color ever so slightly.</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, I have," she answered after a moment's
thought. "But I am ignorant of the means by which you became
cognizant of the fact."</p>

<p>"It does not matter," Mrs. Arnold replied, flushing to a dark
red under the clear pure eyes bent upon her. "Perhaps he told
me himself. One would think that even so elderly a lover would
consult a young lady's guardian and protector before addressing
her! But no matter how I came by my information, you admit
its truth."</p>

<p>"Certainly, madam," Bonnibel answered quietly, but wondering
within herself what all this fencing meant. She was growing
slightly nervous. The fair hands trembled slightly as they
hung lightly clasped before her, and the white and red rose
triumphed alternately in her cheek.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold stood resting her folded arms on the back of a
chair, regarding the lovely young creature as if she had been a
culprit before the bar of justice.</p>

<p>"May I ask what were your reasons for declining the honor
Colonel Carlyle offered you?" she inquired in measured tones.</p>

<p>Bonnibel was half-tempted to deny Mrs. Arnold's right to ask
such a question. With an effort she fought down the quick impulse,
and answered in a voice as gentle as the other's was rude
and self-assertive:</p>

<p>"I did not love him, Aunt Arnold!"</p>

<p>"Love! Love!" sneered the widow contemptuously. "What
had <i>love</i> to do with the matter? You, a poor, penniless, dependent
creature, to prate of love when such a man as Colonel Carlyle
lays his millions at your feet! You should have jumped at
the chance and thanked him for his condescension!"</p>

<p>The listener regarded her with horror and amazement. Her
delicate lips quivered with feeling, and her eyes were misty with
unshed tears.</p>

<p>"Surely, Aunt Arnold," she said, questioningly, "you would
not have had me accept Colonel Carlyle simply for his gold?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would, though," answered Mrs. Arnold roughly, "and
what is more, I intend that you <i>shall</i> accept him, Bonnibel Vere!
Girl, you must have been mad to dream of refusing such a splendid
offer. When Colonel Carlyle returns for his final answer you
will tell him that your first refusal was only a girlish freak of
coquetry, to try his love, and that you accept his offer gratefully."</p>

<p>Bonnibel's cheeks turned as white as her dress, a mist rose before
her eyes, shutting out the sight of her aunt's angry face.</p>

<p>She staggered and put out her hand to steady herself by a
chair. Mrs. Arnold regarded her with an air of cold insolence.</p>

<p>"I thought you would find it rather beyond your strength to
stand before our conversation was over," she remarked, with
slight sarcasm.</p>

<p>Bonnibel did not seem to hear the last shaft of malice. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
answered the preceding words in a voice that she strove to render
steady and controlled.</p>

<p>"I cannot recognize your right to dictate to me in a matter
that concerns myself alone, madam."</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold listened to the proud, calm tones in furious wrath.</p>

<p>"You defy my authority? You refuse to obey me?" she broke
out angrily.</p>

<p>"Your violence leaves me no other alternative, Aunt Arnold,"
said the young girl, trying hard to speak calmly. "I do not
wish to marry yet, and the man whom you wish me to accept as
a husband, could never be the choice of my heart. I cannot
understand why you should wish to force me into a marriage so
unsuitable."</p>

<p>The graceful, womanly dignity of the young girl's words and
manner made no impression on the coarse woman's nature. She
only saw before her the girl she had hated ever since her innocent
babyhood, the girl whose peerless beauty had come between
Felise and her brilliant prospects. She broke out in a passionate
resentment:</p>

<p>"Because I want to be rid of you, girl! You have been a
tumbling-block in my path your whole life, and I hate the very
sight of your baby-face! But I took pity on you and cared for
you when poverty came upon you. In return for my kindness
you stole my daughter's lover! Now you shall marry him and
get out of her way. It is the only reparation you can make her.
Do you think I will allow you to refuse Colonel Carlyle, and remain
here to cheat her out of the next eligible chance that offers?
Never!"</p>

<p>It was hard work for the listener to be so fiercely assailed by
this woman and not break out into the angry remonstrances that
were swelling in her heart. But Bonnibel had learned the difficult
art of self-control lately. She reflected to herself that it was but
natural that Mrs. Arnold should feel sore over the disappointment
and humiliation of her clever, handsome daughter.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to hear that you hate me so much," she said,
a little sadly. "I have had no one to love me since Uncle Francis
died, and I hoped I might win a little place in his wife's heart.
But you wrong me, indeed, in charging me with stealing Felise's
lover. I never dreamed of winning him away from her; I was
deceived by his interest in me, thinking it was simply because he
had been a friend and comrade of my dear papa. I might have
known better, you say. Perhaps I might, but I was blinded by
private troubles of my own, and scarcely heeded what went on
around me. I am very sorry I have been the innocent cause of
pain to Felise."</p>

<p>"Spare her the additional mortification of your sympathy,"
was the ironical answer. "I think she can bear the old dotard's
desertion. She does not desire your regrets, and I believe I have
named the only reparation possible for you."</p>

<p>"And that?" said the girl, slowly.</p>

<p>"Is to marry Colonel Carlyle and get out of her way," was the
harsh reply.</p>

<p>"I cannot do that," said Bonnibel, hurriedly. "It is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
for me to marry Colonel Carlyle&mdash;there are many reasons
why I should not. As to the other, I will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was about to add, "I will go away from here," but a sickening
thought flashed across her. <i>Where</i> could she go?</p>

<p>She had no relative to fly to in her trouble. She did not know
how to work and take care of herself. She had never learned
anything useful, and her education had been mostly limited to
those showy, superficial accomplishments in vogue in the
fashionable world. She had five hundred fashionable friends,
but not one to whom she could turn for comfort in this her dark
hour.</p>

<p>"You say you cannot marry Colonel Carlyle," said Mrs.
Arnold, breaking in on her troubled silence. "Listen to the only
alternative that is left you. I give you until he returns for his
answer to decide in. If you do not then accept him you shall no
longer have the shelter of my roof. Yes, in the very hour that
you refuse Carlyle's millions, I will turn you out homeless into
the streets!"</p>

<p>Into the streets! How the words grated on the girl's horrified
hearing. She had seen them take up a dead girl from the street
once, a girl as young and fair almost as herself.</p>

<p>They said she had poisoned herself because she had no home.
They took her away to the Morgue, but Bonnibel had never forgotten
that fair, still face as it lay cold in death.</p>

<p>She recalled it now with a shiver. Some one had turned the
poor girl into the streets to die. Would that be her fate?</p>

<p>A deadly weakness stole over her. She dropped into a chair
like one shot, and Mrs. Arnold as she stood near her could hear
the loud, wild beating of her heart. Her little white hands
trembled, and her cheeks and lips turned white as marble.</p>

<p>"Aunt Arnold," she said, looking up at the cruel, relentless
woman, "you would not do that, surely? I should have nowhere
to go, and I am so terribly afraid of the night and the
darkness in the dreadful streets of the city!"</p>

<p>"No matter," sneered the listener. "You can go to one of the
finest houses in the city if you like, and have every luxury that
wealth can command&mdash;but if you refuse that, out you go from
under the shelter of this roof!"</p>

<p>There was the sound of some one singing in the flower-garden
outside.</p>

<p>It was Felise. She came in with one handful of roses, while
the other held a newspaper which she was studying with a
thoughtful brow.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," she said, abruptly, "do you recollect that young
artist, Leslie Dane, who used to visit at Sea View last summer?"</p>

<p>A wave of color drifted into the girl's white cheek. She looked
up quickly into the thoughtful face of Felise.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "what of him, Felise?"</p>

<p>"Did he not go to Rome to study painting?" inquired the artful
girl.</p>

<p>"That was his intention, I believe," said Bonnibel, wondering
what was coming now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought so. There can be no mistake, then&mdash;poor fellow!
Look here, Bonnibel."</p>

<p>She put the paper she carried into the young girl's hand, and
touched her taper finger to a marked paragraph.</p>

<p>Bonnibel's eyes followed the jeweled finger and read the few
lines with staring gaze, mutely conscious of the overpowering
scent of the roses that Felise carried in her hand.</p>

<p>Ever afterward Bonnibel associated roses with the thought of
death.</p>

<p>"Died on the 10th of April, at Rome, Italy, of malarial fever,
Leslie Dane, in the 24th year of his age. Mr. Dane was an artist
and a native of the United States of America. <i>Requiescat in
pace.</i>"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p>Felise was prepared to see her rival fall fainting at her feet.</p>

<p>She expected nothing less from the shock to the girl's already
overwrought feelings, and in anticipation she already gloated
over the sight of her sufferings.</p>

<p>But she was mistaken. Bonnibel neither screamed nor fainted.
She sat like one dazed for a moment, her blue eyes riveted to the
paper, and her face growing white as death, while the two
women who hated her watched her with looks of triumph.</p>

<p>The next instant, with a bound like that of a wounded fawn
seeking some leafy covert in which to die, she sprang from her
seat and rushed from the room, clenching the fatal paper in her
hand.</p>

<p>They could hear her light feet flying along the hall and up the
stairs to her own especial apartments.</p>

<p>The two wicked women looked at each other blankly.</p>

<p>"I did not expect her to take it that way," said Mrs. Arnold.</p>

<p>"Nor I," returned Felise. "I looked for a fainting spell, or
some kind of a tragic scene at least."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she does not care much after all," suggested Mrs.
Arnold. "She is young, and the young are proverbially fickle.
She may have ceased to love him."</p>

<p>"No, she has not. I am confident of that, mother. Her face
looked dreadful when she went out. She is too proud to let us
see how she is wounded&mdash;that is all. She turned as white as a
dead woman while she was reading, and there was a hunted,
desperate look in her eyes. Depend upon it she is terribly
stricken."</p>

<p>"Do you think she will consent to marry Colonel Carlyle now,
Felise?"</p>

<p>"I rather think she will after the awful alternative you placed
before her."</p>

<p>"Did you hear our conversation, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Every word of it, mother. I must say you sustained your
part splendidly. I feared you would not display sufficient firmness,
but you came off with flying colors."</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold smiled. She was well-pleased at her daughter's
praise, for though her life was devoted to the service of Felise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
this scheming girl seldom gave her a word or smile of commendation.
She answered quickly:</p>

<p>"I am glad you were pleased, my love. I tried to be as positive
as you wished me to be. I fancied I heard you under the
window once."</p>

<p>"I was there," said Felise, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"She was very much shocked when I threatened to turn her
out of doors," said Mrs. Arnold. "She looked at me quite wildly."</p>

<p>"She will be more shocked when she finds you meant every
word, for, mother, if she does not accept Colonel Carlyle, you
shall certainly drive her away!" exclaimed Felise, and a wild
and lurid gleam of hatred fired her eyes as she spoke, that boded
evil to the fair and innocent girl upon whom she had sworn to
take a terrible revenge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bonnibel flew up the stairs to her own room, still clenching
the fatal paper tightly in her hand, and locking her door, threw
herself downward upon the carpet and lay there like one dead.</p>

<p>She had not fainted. Every nerve was keenly alive and
quivering with pain. Her heart was beating in great, suffocating
throbs, her throat felt stiff and choked as if compressed by
an iron hand, and her head ached terribly as if someone had
hurled a heavy stone upon it.</p>

<p>Her whole being seemed to be but one great pulse of intense
agony, yet she lay still and moveless, save that now and then a
convulsive clutch of the small hand pressed to her throat showed
that life still inhabited that beautiful frame.</p>

<p>Life! The thought came to her suddenly and painfully. She
raised herself slowly and heavily, as if the weight of her sorrow
crushed her down to earth, and the full realization of the terrible
change broke over her. Leslie Dane was <i>dead</i>. That graceful
form, that handsome face was hidden beneath the damp earth
mould. The dark eyes of her artist husband would never shine
down upon her again with the love-light beaming in them, those
lips whose smiles she had loved so well would never press hers
again as they had done that night when he had blessed her and
called her his wife. But <i>she</i>&mdash;she was a living, agonized creature,
the plaything of fate&mdash;oh, God! she thought, clasping her
hands together wildly, oh, God! that she were dead and lying
in the grave with the loved one she would never see again. She
felt in all its passionate intensity the force of another's heart-wrung
utterance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dead, dead!" she moaned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, God! since <i>he</i> could die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world's a grave, and hope lies buried there."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ah! Bonnibel, sweet Bonnibel! It is a dark world indeed on
which your tearful gaze looks forth! It has been the grave of
hope to many, yet destiny pushes us forward blindly, and we cannot
stay her juggernaut wheels as they roll over our hearts.</p>

<p>"I am eighteen years old, and I am a <i>widow</i>," she moans at last,
and staggers blindly to her feet, pushing back the fair locks from
her brow with shaking hands. "<i>I am a widow!</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh! the pathos of the words! As she speaks them she draws
the blinds, drops the curtains, and the room is shrouded in darkness.
She has shut out the world from the sight of suffering.
You and I, my reader, will turn aside, too, from the contemplation
of that cruelly tried young heart as it fights the battle in the
gloom and silence.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Six days later Colonel Carlyle was ushered into Mrs. Arnold's
drawing-room and sent up his card to Miss Vere.</p>

<p>After a slight delay she came gliding in, pale and pure as a
snow-drop, and demure as a little nun. Colonel Carlyle both felt
and saw that some subtle and indefinable change had come over
her as he bowed over the cold, white hand she placed in his.</p>

<p>It was a very warm day, even for May; but she was clothed
from head to foot in heavy mourning draped with crape. Her
golden hair was brushed straight back from her temples and
gathered into a simple coil fastened with a comb of jet. From
that somber setting her fair face and bright hair shone like a
star.</p>

<p>"You are pale, Bonnibel; I trust you have not been ill," exclaimed
the ancient suitor anxiously.</p>

<p>"I am as well as usual," she answered, with a slight, cold
smile.</p>

<p>They sat down, and the ardent lover at once plunged into the
subject nearest his heart.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel, I have come for my answer, you know," he said.
"I hope and trust it may be a favorable one."</p>

<p>The girl's sweeping lashes lifted a moment from her pale cheeks,
and her blue eyes regarded him sadly; but she did not speak. He
bent down and lifted her white, listless hand in his and held it
fondly.</p>

<p>"My dear, shall it be yes?" he inquired. "Will you give me
this precious little treasure?"</p>

<p>Bonnibel looked down at the hand that lay in the colonel's&mdash;it
was the one which wore the opal ring&mdash;that beautiful, changeful
gem. Its colors were dim and pale to-day. She shivered slightly,
as if with cold.</p>

<p>"Colonel Carlyle, I told you when we spoke of this before that
I did not love you," she said, faintly.</p>

<p>The colonel did not appear to be disheartened by this plaintive
plea.</p>

<p>"At least you do not hate me, Bonnibel," he said, half questioningly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she answered quickly; "I like you very much, Colonel
Carlyle. You have been so very kind to me, you know&mdash;but
it is only the liking one has for a friend&mdash;it is in no way akin
to love."</p>

<p>"I will try to be contented with just your friendly liking, my
dear one, if you will give yourself to me," he answered, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe I could give you a daughter's affection, but never
that of a wife," she murmured.</p>

<p>He did not in the least understand the swift, appealing look of
the eyes that were raised a moment to his own. A swift thought
had rushed over her and she had given it words:</p>

<p>"Oh, that he would adopt me for his daughter and save me
from either of those two alternatives that lie before me," she
thought, wildly. "He might do so for papa's sake, and I would
make him a very devoted daughter!"</p>

<p>But the sighing lover did not want a daughter&mdash;he was after a
wife.</p>

<p>"I will take you even on those terms," he replied. "Let me
give you the shelter of my name, and we will see if I cannot
soon win a warmer place in your heart."</p>

<p>She shook her head and a heavy sigh drifted across her lips.</p>

<p>"Do not deceive yourself, Colonel Carlyle," she said. "My
heart is dead. I shall never love any one."</p>

<p>"I will risk all that," he answered. "Only say yes, most peerless
of women, and so that I call you mine I will risk all else!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?" she asked, earnestly. "The hand without
the heart&mdash;would that content you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, bent on attaining his end, and foolishly
believing that he could teach her to love him. "Yes; am I to
have it, Bonnibel?"</p>

<p>"It shall be as you wish," she answered, quietly, and leaning
slightly forward she laid in his the hand she had withdrawn
a while ago.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle was beside himself with rapture.</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks, my beautiful darling," he exclaimed,
pressing passionate kisses on the small hand. "Nay, do not
take it away so soon, my love. Let me first place on it the pledge
of our betrothal."</p>

<p>Still and white as marble sat Bonnibel while the enraptured
colonel slipped over her taper forefinger a magnificent diamond
ring, costly enough for a queen to wear. Its brilliant stone flashed
fire, and the opal on her third finger seemed to grow dull and
cold.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So Bonnibel had made her choice.</p>

<p>Her nature was tender, refined, luxurious. She was afraid of
poverty and cold, and darkness; yet if Leslie Dane had lived she
would have faced them all rather than have chosen Mrs. Arnold's
alternative.</p>

<p>But Leslie Dane was dead. Life was over and done for her.
There was nothing to do but to die or forget. Death would have
come soon enough in the streets, perhaps, but she was <i>so</i> afraid of
such a death. So she took "the goods the gods provided," and
blindly threw herself forward into the whirling vortex of fate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was not to be expected that Colonel Carlyle would be willing
to defer his happiness. He was well-stricken in years, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
had no time to spare in idle waiting. He therefore pressed Bonnibel
to name an early day for the wedding.</p>

<p>She had no choice in the matter, and allowed him to name the
day himself.</p>

<p>Armed with her permission, he consulted Mrs. Arnold in regard
to the earliest possible date for his happiness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold, tutored by Felise, was all smiling graciousness,
and fully appreciated his eagerness. She thought it quite possible
that a suitable and elegant <i>trousseau</i> might be provided for a
wedding on the twenty-fifth of June.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p>Bonnibel's wedding-day dawned cloudless, fair and beautiful.
The sun shone, the flowers bloomed, the birds sang. Nothing
was wanting to complete the charm of the day.</p>

<p>Nothing? Ah! yes. The most important thing of all&mdash;the
light and happy heart that should beat in the breast of a bride
was lacking there.</p>

<p>She was beautiful "in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,"
but she looked like a statue carved in marble. No warmth or
color tinged the strange pallor of her face and lips, no light of love
shone in the violet eyes that drooped beneath the sweeping
lashes. She spoke and moved like a soundless automaton.</p>

<p>Bonnibel had pleaded for a private marriage, but Colonel Carlyle
had set his heart on a marriage at church, with all the paraphernalia
of a fashionable wedding. He wanted to show the
whole world what a peerless prize he was winning. He had urged
the point with the persistency and almost obstinacy that is characteristic
of age, and Bonnibel had yielded recklessly. She told
herself that it did not matter what they did with her. Her heart
was broken and her life was ruined.</p>

<p>She was not in a position to dictate terms. Wretched, dejected,
friendless; what mattered this crowning humiliation of being
decked in satin and pearls and orange flowers, and paraded before
all eyes as a beautiful slave that an old man had bought with
his gold.</p>

<p>Well, it was over. She had gone to the church with him, the
wide portals had opened to receive her, the wedding march had
pealed over her head, the beautiful bridesmaids had gone with
her to the altar in their gala dresses, and carrying little baskets of
flowers on their arms, and she had spoken the words that made
her the bride of Colonel Carlyle. The fashionable world had
flocked to witness the pageant, and nodded approval and congratulated
both. And <i>now</i>?</p>

<p>Now the wedding breakfast was over, the "dear five hundred
friends" had departed, and Mrs. Carlyle stood arrayed in her
traveling dress.</p>

<p>Long Branch was to be the first destination of the wedded pair&mdash;they
had made no further arrangements yet. Mrs. Arnold and
Felise had promised to join them there in a few days by the
groom's express invitation.</p>

<p>Felise had behaved so decorously after being thrown overboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
by her fickle suitor that the colonel felt that it behooved him to
show his appreciation of her conduct by every delicate attention
that was possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p>He had, therefore, insisted on their company at Long Branch
while he and the bride remained there, and the two ladies had
promised to join them there in a day or two at farthest.</p>

<p>Nothing but the coldest civilities had passed between the outraged
Bonnibel and the mother and daughter since the day when
Mrs. Arnold had cruelly insulted and threatened the helpless
girl.</p>

<p>Bonnibel had kept her room almost entirely after that day, acquainting
her uncle's wife with her acceptance of Colonel Carlyle
by a brief note sent by Lucy, though she might have spared herself
the trouble, for Mrs. Arnold and her daughter had both been
witnesses of the colonel's happiness.</p>

<p>The bride-elect had been threatened by an avalanche of milliners
and dressmakers at first, but she had resolutely declined to
have anything to do with the details of her bridal outfit.</p>

<p>She had suffered a fashionable <i>modiste</i> to take her measure
once, and after that Mrs. Arnold was forced to give her <i>carte
blanche</i> in the whole matter of taste, expense and arrangement.
Bonnibel would dictate nothing in the preparation of those hated
garments in which she was to be sacrificed.</p>

<p>It was all over now. She stood in the hallway of the splendid
home that had sheltered her childhood, waiting for the carriage
that would bear her away on her honey-moon trip. She was
leaving that dear home forever; a quick tear sprang to her eyes as
the servants crowded around her with their humble, sorrowful
adieux.</p>

<p>Lucy was to go with her, but the others, many of whom had
been valued domestics in the house for years, she might never
see again.</p>

<p>They all loved her, and their farewells and good wishes were
the most fervent and heart-felt she had ever received.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle, though a little impatient, was pleased at these
humble manifestations and distributed gratuities among them
with a liberal hand. He wondered a little at the tears that
crowded into the blue eyes of his girl-wife. He did not know
that she was thinking of the dear uncle with whom she had spent
so many hours beneath this roof. Ah, those happy days! How
far they lay behind her now in the green land of memory!</p>

<p>"Come, dearest," he said, drawing her small hand through his
arm and leading her away, "you must not dim those bright eyes
with tears."</p>

<p>He led her down the steps, placed her in the carriage that was
gay with wedding favors, and Mrs. Arnold and Felise airily kissed
the tips of their fingers to them. Janet threw an old slipper
after the carriage for good luck, and then Bonnibel was whirled
away to the new life that lay before her.</p>

<p>"I came very near being the bride in that carriage myself,"
said Felise, turning away from the drawing-room window.
"But 'there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>The tone was light, almost laughing; but Mrs. Arnold, turning
to look at her, read a different story in her eyes.</p>

<p>The slighted beauty looked very fair and handsome to-day.
She had been the first bridesmaid, and her dress rivaled that of
the bride itself for richness and elegance.</p>

<p>It was a creamy satin, heavily embroidered with pearl beads
and draped with rich lace, caught up here and there with deep-hearted
yellow roses. Her glossy black hair was adorned with the
same flowers, and a necklace of sparkling topaz made a circlet of
pale flame around her white throat. A dainty little basket of
yellow roses had hung upon her arm, but she had thrown it down
now and stood trampling the senseless flowers with fury in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"My dear!" exclaimed the mother, in some trepidation.</p>

<p>"Don't 'my dear' me," Felise answered, furiously. "I am not
in a mood to be cajoled."</p>

<p>She began to pace the floor impatiently, her rich dress rustling
over the floor, her white hands busy tearing the roses from about
her and throwing them down as if she hated the beautiful things
whose crushed petals sent out a rich perfume as if in faint protest
against her cruelty. There was a wild glare akin to that of
madness in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"'Hell has no fury like a woman scorned!'" she said, repeating
the words of the great poet. "Oh, mother, how I hate
Colonel Carlyle and his wife! I seem to live but for revenge."</p>

<p>"Felise, you frighten me with your looks and words," Mrs.
Arnold said, a little anxiously. "You seem like one on the verge
of madness."</p>

<p>"I am," she said, stopping in her hurried walk a moment, and
laughing a low, blood-curdling laugh, "but never fear, mother,
'there is method in my madness!'"</p>

<p>"I wish you would give up this scheme of revenge," pursued
the mother, anxiously. "I hate them as much as you do, I know,
but then we have got rid of the girl, and the misery she feels as
the wife of a man she cannot love is a very fair revenge upon
her. Remember we have despoiled her of everything, Felise, and
given her over to a life that will make her wretched. Is not that
enough?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not!" exclaimed her daughter, in low, concentrated
tones, full of deep passion. "But, mother, what has changed
you so? You used to be as vindictive as a tigress&mdash;now you plead
with me to forego my revenge."</p>

<p>"Because I am afraid for you, my dear," Mrs. Arnold answered
in troubled tones. "I fear that your mind will give way under
this dreadful strain. I have never told you, Felise, but I will
do so now that you may guard yourself against yourself. <i>There
was a taint of madness</i> in your father's family, and when I see you
brooding, brooding over your revenge, I am afraid, afraid!"</p>

<p>The excited creature only laughed more wildly as she continued
her walk.</p>

<p>"Felise," the mother continued, "we have wealth, power,
position, and you are beautiful. We can make life a long summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
day of pleasure. Let us do so, and throw every vexing care
to the winds."</p>

<p>"Mother, I cannot do it," Felise exclaimed. "I have been
cruelly humiliated in the eyes of world&mdash;everyone expected
Colonel Carlyle to marry me&mdash;do you think I will tamely bear
their sneers and contempt? No; the man who has brought such
odium upon me shall bitterly rue the day he first looked upon
the siren face of Bonnibel Vere!"</p>

<p>"My love, do you remember the prediction of Wild Madge
the sibyl? She said 'you would have everything and lose everything,
because the gods had made you mad.'"</p>

<p>"Who cares for the predictions of that crazy old witch? What
can she know of the future? I wish she were dead and out of
the way!" exclaimed the angry girl, clenching her small white
hands impotently together. "Mother, have done with your
warnings and pleadings. I will not have them! You seem to
be undergoing a softening process of the heart and brain&mdash;perhaps
both," and with a mocking laugh she swept from the
apartment.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Among all the radiant beauties that promenaded the beach and
danced in the ball rooms at Long Branch, the young bride of
Colonel Carlyle became immediately distinguished for her pre-eminent
loveliness.</p>

<p>Wherever she went she created a great sensation.</p>

<p>People went to the places where they heard she would be, just
to look at that "faultily faultless" face "star-sweet on a
gloom profound."</p>

<p>Artists raved over her form and features. They said she was
the fairest woman in the world, and that her beauty had but one
fault&mdash;it was too cold and pale. One touch of glow and color in
that "passionless, pale, cold face," they said, would have made
her so lovely that men would have gone mad for her&mdash;gone mad
or died.</p>

<p>And then she was so young, they said. She had never been
presented in society. Colonel Carlyle, the cunning old fox, had
married her out of the schoolroom before anyone had a chance
to see her. The fops and dandies swore at him behind their
waxed mustaches, while better and nobler men said it was a
shame that such a fair, charming girl should be wedded to such
an old man.</p>

<p>There were some who said that the girl, young as she was, had
a hidden heart-history. These were the poets and dreamers.
They said that the language of those pale cheeks and drooping
eyes was that she had been torn from her handsome lover's side
and bartered for an old man's gold.</p>

<p>But these were mere conjectures. No one knew anything
about her certainly, until Mrs. Arnold and Felise came down
after a week's delay. Then they knew that she was the daughter
of General Vere, and the niece of Francis Arnold, the murdered
millionaire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Felise told them of the artist lover who had murdered the
millionaire because he would not give him his niece. The excitement
only ran higher than before, and people looked at the
young creature with even more curiosity and interest than ever.</p>

<p>Bonnibel could not help seeing that she was an object of interest
and admiration to everyone about her. She saw that the men
sought her side eagerly and often, and that the women were
jealous of her. At first she was vexed and angry about it. She
could not get a moment to herself. They were always seeking
her out, always hovering about her like butterflies round a flower.
She wondered why they came round her so, but at length she remembered
what she had almost forgotten. Uncle Francis had
often told her so; Leslie Dane had told her so; she had heard it
from others, too, and even Wild Madge had admitted it.</p>

<p>Ah! Wild Madge! Over her memory rushed the words of the
fearful old hag, freighted with a deeper meaning than they had
held at first.</p>

<p>"You are beautiful, but your beauty will be your bane."
"Years of sorrow lie before you!" "You will be a young man's
bride, but an old man's darling!"</p>

<p>"It has all come true," she thought, turning from the circle
around her, and looking wistfully out over the waves that came
swelling against the shore, like some wild heart beating
against the bars of life. "It has all come true&mdash;yet how little I
dreamed that she could read the future that lies folded, like the
leaves of a book, from first sight. How little I thought that a
shadow could ever fall between me and happiness! Yet in a few
short months her wild prediction has been fulfilled. I have
drank deeply of sorrow's cup. I have been a young man's bride;
now they say I am an old man's darling. All&mdash;all has been fulfilled
save the shame and disgrace with which she threatened me.
But that can never come, never, <i>never</i>!" and a look of pride came
over the fair face, and the round throat was curved defiantly.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle was quite happy and proud at first over the
sensation created by his beautiful girl-wife. He liked to see
how much people admired her. It pleased him to note the admiring
glances that followed her slightest movement.</p>

<p>She belonged to him, and all the admiration she excited was
a tribute to his taste and his pride.</p>

<p>For a whole week he was as pleased and happy as a man could
be, but a shadow fell upon him with the coming of Felise. He
grew morbidly jealous.</p>

<p>Jealous, and without a shadow of reason, for Bonnibel was
like the chaste and lovely moon&mdash;she shone coldly and alike upon
all.</p>

<p>But the colonel became a changed man&mdash;everyone noticed it,
and many said that the old man was growing jealous of his
beautiful darling.</p>

<p>But no one could tell how it came about, not even Felise Herbert,
who, when questioned by her mother, refused to admit
that the faintest, most insidious hint from her lips had been
dropped like poison into the cup of perfect happiness from which
the doting old husband was fondly drinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>One morning a note lay on his dressing-table&mdash;a little note
scrawled in a disguised hand&mdash;he took it up and read it, then
put it down again and stood gazing blankly at it as if it were
the death-warrant of his happiness. It was very short, but every
word was stamped indelibly on his memory.</p>

<p>"Your wife," it ran, "wears a little opal ring on the third
finger of her right hand. She prizes it more than all the costly
jewels you have lavished upon her. It was the gift of a former
lover whom she still adores. Ask her to cease wearing the ring,
or even to show you the inscription inside, and you will see who
has the warmest place in her heart."</p>

<p>Could this be true? Was this a friend who warned him, he
thought. He remembered the pretty little ring perfectly.</p>

<p>The jealous pang that had been tearing at his heart for days
grew sharper than ever.</p>

<p>He knew his wife did not love him yet, but he had fondly
hoped to win her heart in time.</p>

<p>If what the writer of that anonymous letter said was true,
then it was vain to hope any longer.</p>

<p>"A former lover whom she still adored." Oh! God, could
that be true?</p>

<p>"I will test her," he said to himself. "No one shall poison
my mind against my beautiful wife without a cause. 'I will
put it to the test and win or lose it all.'"</p>

<p>He went to a jeweler's that morning and came back with a
little box in his vest-pocket.</p>

<p>Then he asked Bonnibel if she would walk down to the seashore
with him.</p>

<p>She complied with a gentle smile, and he found her a shady
seat a little off from the crowd, where they could talk uninterrupted.</p>

<p>She laid down her parasol, and removing her delicate gloves
folded her white hands listlessly together.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle took up the hand that wore the opal ring and
looked at it fondly.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, "that is a very pretty ring you wear, but
it is not beautiful enough for your perfect hand. I have brought
you a much handsomer one with which to replace it."</p>

<p>He took it from his pocket and showed it to her&mdash;a lovely,
shimmering opal set round with gleaming pearls.</p>

<p>"I have heard that opals are unlucky stones," he said, "but if
you are not superstitious, and like to wear them, will you lay
aside the simple one you now have and put this on instead?" and
he made a movement as if he would withdraw the tabooed one
from her finger.</p>

<p>Bonnibel withdrew her hand quickly, and looked up into Colonel
Carlyle's face.</p>

<p>He saw her delicate lips quiver, and a dimness creep over her
eyes, while her cheeks grew, if anything, paler than ever. Her
voice trembled slightly as she answered:</p>

<p>"I thank you for your beautiful gift; but I cannot consent to
wear it in the place of the plainer one I now have."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"And why not, my dear little wife? It would look much
handsomer than the one you now wear on your finger."</p>

<p>A faint flush tinged her snow-white cheek at the half-sarcastic
emphasis of his words. Her glance wandered off to the sunlit
sea and a tear rolled down her check as she said, very gently:</p>

<p>"I am quite aware of that, Colonel Carlyle. Your ring is a
marvel of beauty and taste, and I will wear it on another finger
if you like; but I prize the other more for its associations than
for its beauty or value. It was a keepsake from a friend. You
remember the pretty words of the old song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Who has not kept some trifling thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">More prized than jewels rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A faded flower, a broken ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A tress of golden hair?'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was a tone of unconscious pleading in her pathetic voice,
and the heart of the jealous old husband gave a throb of pain as
he listened.</p>

<p>"It is true, then," he thought to himself. "It was a gift of a
former lover."</p>

<p>Aloud he said rather coldly:</p>

<p>"Since you prize it so much as a keepsake, Bonnibel, put it
away in some secret place, and preserve it as romantic people do
such treasures&mdash;it will be safer thus."</p>

<p>"I prefer to wear it, sir," she answered, with a glance of surprise
at the persistency.</p>

<p>"But I do not wish you to wear it. I particularly desire that
you should lay it aside and wear the one I have brought you
instead," he insisted, rather sharply goaded on by jealousy and
dread.</p>

<p>Bonnibel turned her eyes away from the blue waves of the
ocean and looked curiously at her husband. She saw that he was
in desperate earnest. His dark eyes flashed with almost the fire
of youth, and his features worked with some inward emotion
she did not in the least understand.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to refuse your request, sir," she answered, a little
gravely; "though I am surprised that you should insist upon it
when I have plainly expressed a contrary wish. I can only repeat
what I have said before, that I prefer to wear it."</p>

<p>"Against my wishes, Bonnibel?"'</p>

<p>"I hope that you will not further oppose it, sir, on the ground
of a mere caprice," she answered, flushing warmly. "It was the
gift of a dear friend, who is dead, and I shall always wear it in
remembrance."</p>

<p>"The gift of a former lover, perhaps," sneered Colonel Carlyle,
half beside himself with jealousy.</p>

<p>"I suppose it cannot matter to you, Colonel Carlyle, who the
giver may have been," exclaimed Bonnibel, offended at his overbearing
tone, and flushing indignantly.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but it does matter, Bonnibel. I dislike exceedingly
to see my wife wearing the ring of one whom she loves
better than her husband! Common regard for my feelings
should induce you to lay it aside without forcing me to issue a
command to that effect!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>His jealous pain or innate tyranny was fast getting the better
of his prudence, or he would scarcely have taken such a tone
with the young wife whose heart he so ardently longed to win.
She sprang up impetuously and looked down at him with the
fires of awakened resentment burning hotly upon her cheeks,
looking beautiful with the glow and warmth of passion in the
face that had been too cold and pale before. The same proud
spirit that had forced her to defy her Uncle Francis that memorable
night animated her now.</p>

<p>"I think you will hardly dare issue such a command to me,
Colonel Carlyle. Remember that though I am your wife I am
not your slave!"</p>

<p>How fair she looked in his eyes even as she indignantly defied
his authority! But passion had made him blind to reason and
justice. With a swift glance around to assure himself that no
one was in sight, he caught her small hand and tried to wrench
the ring from her finger by force.</p>

<p>"At least I will see whose hated name is written within the
precious jewel!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Release me, this moment, Colonel Carlyle! If you dare to
persevere in such a cowardly and brutal course, I swear to you
that I will never live with you another day! Yes, I would leave
you within the hour were I twice your wife!" cried the girl, in
such passionate wrath and scorn that the colonel let go of her
hand in sheer surprise at the transformation of his dove.</p>

<p>"You would not dare do such a thing!" he exclaimed, vehemently.</p>

<p>"Would I not?" she answered, with flashing eyes. "I dare do
anything! Beware how you put me to the test!"</p>

<p>He stood glaring at her with rage and malignity distorting his
aristocratic features. How dared that feeble, puny girl defy him
thus?</p>

<p>For a moment he almost hated her. A sleeping devil was
aroused within his heart.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he exclaimed, angrily, "you shall repent this
hour in dust and ashes!"</p>

<p>All the latent fire and scorn of the girl's passionate nature
were fanned into flame by his threatening words.</p>

<p>"I care nothing for your threat," she answered, haughtily.
"I defy you to do your worst! Such threats do honor to your
manhood when addressed to a weak and helpless girl! See how
little I prize the gift of one who could act in so unmanly a way."</p>

<p>She stooped and caught up his ring where it had fallen on the
sands in all its shining beauty. She made a step forward towards
the water, her white hand flashed in the air a moment,
and the costly jewel fell shimmering into the sea.</p>

<p>They stood a moment looking at each other in silence&mdash;the girl
reckless, defiant, like a young lioness at bay; the man astonished,
indignant, yet still thrilled with a sort of inexpressible admiration
of her beauty and her daring. He saw in her that moment
some of the dauntless courage of her hero-father. The same
proud, untamed spirit flashed from her glorious eyes. It flashed
across him suddenly and humiliatingly that he had been a fool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to try such high-handed measures with General Vere's daughter&mdash;he
might have known that the same unconquerable fire burned
in her veins. He had seen Harry Vere go into the battle with
the same look on his face&mdash;the same flashing eye, the same dilated
nostril and disdainful lip.</p>

<p>He went up to her, thrilled with momentary compunction for
his fault, and took her hand in his.</p>

<p>"You were right, Bonnibel," he said, humbly. "I acted like a
coward and a brute. I was driven mad by jealousy. Can you
forgive me, darling?"</p>

<p>"I accept your apology, sir," she answered, coldly; but there
was little graciousness and much pride in her manner. Her
pride had been outraged almost past forgiveness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>


<p>Colonel Carlyle keeps the peace for several days. He finds
that he has overstepped the mark and that it will take careful
management to regain his lost ground in his wife's regard. Bonnibel,
though she married him without a spark of love, has yet
given him a very frank and tender regard and esteem until now.
She has always thought him a perfect gentleman, a model of
courtesy and propriety, and as such she has given him all that
was left in her heart to give&mdash;the reverence and affection of a
dutiful daughter. Now, without a moment's warning, her ideal
has fallen from the proud pedestal where she had placed it&mdash;its
shattered fragments bestrewed the ground, and <i>she</i> knows, if he
does not, that the broken image can never be restored.</p>

<p>He has deceived her, she tells herself bitterly, but now that he
has won her, the mask of courtliness is laid aside, and he shows
the iron hand that was hidden beneath the velvet glove.</p>

<p>But a few short weeks had fled, and he begins to play the
tyrant already.</p>

<p>Her passionate, undisciplined nature rises up in hot rebellion
against his injustice. The foolish jealousy of his old age appears
very contemptible to her youthful eyes. She does not try to excuse
it to herself. A great revulsion of feeling comes over her,
chilling the gentle growth of tenderness and gratitude in her
heart. Her manner grows cold, reserved, almost offensively
haughty.</p>

<p>Ere this first cloud on the matrimonial horizon clears away the
grand ball of the season comes off. The gay visitors at Long
Branch dance every night, but this is to be the most brilliant
affair of any&mdash;a "full dress affair" is what the ladies call it&mdash;meaning
to say that they wear their finest dresses and costliest
jewels&mdash;the gentlemen likewise.</p>

<p>The night is cloudless, balmy, beautiful&mdash;such nights as we
have in the last of July when the moon is full and Heaven martials
its hosts of stars in the illimitable canopy above. The spacious
ball-room is thronged with revelers. The dreamy, passionate
strains of waltz-music float out upon the air, filling it with
melody.</p>

<p>Standing beside a window is Colonel Carlyle, in elegant evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
dress, looking very stately and distinguished despite his seventy
years. Leaning on his arm is Felise Herbert, looking radiant in
rose-colored satin and gauze, with a diamond fillet clasping her
dark hair, and diamonds shining like dew on her bare throat and
rounded arms. Smiles dimple her red lips as she watches the
animated scene about her, and her dark eyes shine like stars.
Her companion thinks that he never saw her half so handsome
before as she hangs on his arm and chatters airy nothings in his
ears.</p>

<p>"Look at our little Bonnibel," she says, in a tone of innocent
amusement; "is she not a demure little coquette? She looks like
a veritable snow-maiden, as cold and as pure, yet she has young
Penn inextricably prisoned in her toils, and everyone knows it&mdash;no
one better than herself."</p>

<p>His glance follows hers across the room to where his young
wife stands a little outside the giddy circle of waltzers, leaning
on the arm of a handsome, dreamy-looking youth, and despite
the jealous pang that thrills him at Felise's artful speech, his
heart throbs with a great love and pride at her exceeding
beauty.</p>

<p>She looks like a snow-maiden, indeed, as her enemy says. She
wears costly white lace over her white silk, and her cheeks and
brow, her arms and shoulders are white as her dress. Colonel
Carlyle's wedding gift, a magnificent set of diamonds, adorns
her royally. There is not a flower about her, nothing but silk
and laces and costly gems, yet withal, she makes you think of
a lily, she looks so white, and cold, and pure in the whirl of rainbow
hues around her.</p>

<p>Her companion bends toward her, speaking earnestly, yet she
listens with such apparent indifference and almost ennui that if
that be coquetry at all it can surely be characterized by no other
term than that of Felise&mdash;"demure."</p>

<p>"I thought that Penn's loves were all ideal ones," the colonel
says, trying to speak carelessly as he watches his wife's companion
closely. "To judge from his latest volumes of poems,
the divinities of his worship are all too ethereal to tread this lower
earth."</p>

<p>Felise laughs significantly as her companion ceases to speak.</p>

<p>"Byron Penn, despite the ethereal creatures of his brain, is
not proof against mortal beauty," she says. "Remember, Colonel
Carlyle, that angels once looked down from Heaven and loved
the women of earth."</p>

<p>"He is a graceful waltzer," her companion returns, as the
young poet circles the waist of the snow-maiden with one arm
and whirls her into the mazes of the giddy, breathless waltz.</p>

<p>"Very," says Felise, watching the graceful couple as they float
around the room, embodying the very poetry of motion.</p>

<p>She is silent a moment, then looks up into her companion's
face with a slightly curious expression.</p>

<p>"Pardon my question," she says, thoughtfully; "but do you
quite approve of <i>married</i> women waltzing with other men than
their husbands?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>He starts and looks at her sharply. The innocent deference
and unconsciousness of her voice and face are perfect.</p>

<p>"Since you ask me," he says, slowly, "I may say that upon
mature consideration I might think it was not exactly <i>comme il
faut</i>. Yet I have really never before given a second thought to
the subject. It is quite customary, you know, and it seems even
more excusable in my wife than other women, since I never waltz
myself, and she would be compelled to forego that pleasure entirely
unless she shared it with others."</p>

<p>"Oh, pray do not think that I have any reference to Bonnibel,"
exclaimed Felise, hurried and earnestly, "I was speaking altogether
in the abstract. Yet I fully agree with you that your wife
would be more excusable for many little errors of head and heart
than most women. She is scarcely more than a child, and has
never had the proper training to fit her for her present sphere.
Her uncle was culpably indulgent to her, and hated to force her
inclination, which was very adverse to study or application of
any kind. Consequently our little Bonnibel, though beautiful as
a dream, is little more than an unformed child. She should be in
the school-room this minute."</p>

<p>Every word is spoken with such a pretty air of excusing and
defending the young wife's errors, and condemning her dead
uncle as their cause, that Colonel Carlyle is entirely deceived.
He did not know that Bonnibel was so neglected and unformed
before, but he takes it on trust since Felise is so confident of it,
and the thought rankles bitterly in his proud heart. But he
passes over the subject in silence and returns to the primal one.</p>

<p>"So you would not, as a rule, Miss Herbert, commend the
practice of married women waltzing with other men than their
husbands?"</p>

<p>She drops her eyes with a pretty air of mingled confusion and
earnestness.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will call me prudish," she says, "or perhaps I
may be actuated by the more ignoble passion of jealousy; but I
have always felt that were I a man it would be insupportable
shame and agony for me to see my wife, whom I loved and revered
as a being little lower than an angel, whirled about a common
ball-room in the arms of another, while the gaping public
nodded and winked."</p>

<p>She saw a look of shame and pain cross his face as his eyes followed
the white figure floating round the room in the clasp of
Byron Penn's arms.</p>

<p>"I suppose there are not many women who feel as strongly
on that subject as you do," he says, slowly.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no, nor men either, or they would not permit their
wives such license," is the quick reply.</p>

<p>The waltz-music ceases with a bewildering crash of melody, and
some one comes up and claims Felise for the next german. She
floats away airily as a rose-colored cloud on her partner's arm,
and leaves her victim alone. He stands there quite silently
a little, seeming lost in troubled thought, then goes to seek his
wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>He finds her the center of an admiring circle, the young poet,
Byron Penn, conspicuous among them.</p>

<p>With a slight apology to his friends he offers his arm and leads
her away from the throng out to the long moonlighted piazzas.</p>

<p>"Shall I find you a seat or will you promenade?" he inquires
politely.</p>

<p>"Oh! promenade, by all means," she answers a little constrainedly.</p>

<p>They take a few turns up and down the long piazza, Mrs.
Carlyle's long robe trailing after her with a silken "swish,
swish;" she makes no observation, does not even look at him.</p>

<p>Her large eyes wander away and linger upon the sea that is
glorious beyond description with the radiance of the full moon
mirrored in its deeps, and making a pathway of light across its
restless waves.</p>

<p>She thinks vaguely that the golden streets of the celestial city
must look like that.</p>

<p>"I hope you are enjoying the ball?" her liege lord observes interrogatively.</p>

<p>"As much as I ever enjoy anything," she returns listlessly.</p>

<p>"Which means&mdash;&mdash;" he says, quickly, then checks himself abruptly.</p>

<p>She finishes his sentence with a dreary little sigh:</p>

<p>"That I do not enjoy anything very much!"</p>

<p>He looks down at her, wondering at the unusual pathos of her
tone, and sees a face to match the voice.</p>

<p>Moonlight they say brings out the true expression of the soul
upon the features.</p>

<p>If that be true then Bonnibel Carlyle bears a sad and weary
soul within her breast.</p>

<p>The white face looks very <i>spirituelle</i> in the soft, mystical light,
and the delicate lips are set in a line of pain.</p>

<p>No man likes to see his wife unhappy. It is a reflection upon
himself. It is his first duty to secure her happiness. Colonel
Carlyle is nettled, and says, half querulously:</p>

<p>"I am sorry to see you <i>ennuyed</i> where everything seems conspiring
to promote your happiness. Can I do nothing to further
that end?"</p>

<p>Her large eyes look up at him a moment in grave surprise at
his fretful tone. Then she says to herself in apology for him:</p>

<p>"He is old, and I have heard that old people become irritated
very easily."</p>

<p>"Pray do not trouble yourself over my thoughtless words, sir,"
she says, aloud. "I am tired&mdash;that is all. Perhaps I have
danced too much."</p>

<p>"It was of that subject I wished to speak with you when I
brought you out here," he answers, abruptly. "Are you very
fond of the waltz, Bonnibel?"</p>

<p>"I like it quite well;" this after a moment's study. "There is
something dreamy, intoxicating, almost delightful in the music
and the motion."</p>

<p>A spasm of jealousy contracts his heart. He speaks quickly
and with a labored breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have never waltzed in my life, and cannot, of course, enter
into the feelings of those who have, but I can see what I am about
to ask may be a great sacrifice to you."</p>

<p>She glances up inquiringly into his face, but he will not meet
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel, I want you to give up waltzing altogether&mdash;will
you do it?" he asks, bruskly.</p>

<p>"Give up waltzing?" she echoes, in surprise. "Is not that a
very sudden notion, Colonel Carlyle? I did not know you harbored
any objections to the Terpsichorean art."</p>

<p>"I do not in the abstract," he answers, evasively. "But you
will pardon me for saying that I consider it exceedingly indelicate
and improper for a married woman to dance with any man
but her husband. That is why I have asked you to give it up
for my sake."</p>

<p>"Do other people think the same way, sir?" she inquires
timidly.</p>

<p>"All right-minded people do," he answers firmly, quite ignoring
the fact that he is a perfectly new proselyte to his boldly announced
conviction of the heinousness of the waltz.</p>

<p>Silence falls between them for a little time. They have stopped
walking and stand leaning against the piazza rails. Quite
unconsciously she has pulled a flower from his elegant <i>boutonniere</i>,
and is tearing it to pieces between her white-gloved
fingers. She looks up as the last rose-leaf is shredded away between
her restless fingers and asks, quietly:</p>

<p>"Would it please you very much to have me give up waltzing,
sir?"</p>

<p>"More than words can express, my darling; are you going to
make me happy by the promise?"</p>

<p>"I am quite willing to please you, sir, when it is possible for
me to do so," she answers quite gently; "you have my promise."</p>

<p>"Bonnibel, you are an angel!" exclaims the enraptured colonel.
He draws his arm around her an instant and bends to kiss her
lips. "A thousand thanks for your generous self-sacrifice!"</p>

<p>"You need not thank me, sir&mdash;it is not much of a sacrifice,"
she answers, dryly.</p>

<p>She has drawn out her programme of the dances for the evening
and is hurriedly consulting it.</p>

<p>"I find that I am engaged for one more waltz," she says, carelessly.
"I suppose you do not object to my dancing that? It
would be embarrassing to excuse myself."</p>

<p>"Your partner is&mdash;whom?" he inquires, with a slight frown.</p>

<p>Again she consults her programme.</p>

<p>"It is Mr. Penn."</p>

<p>"Cannot you excuse yourself? Say you are tired? Your head
aches? Women know how to invent suitable excuses always&mdash;do
they not?"</p>

<p>"I will do as you wish, sir," she answers, in so low a voice that
he does not catch its faint inflection of scorn.</p>

<p>Other promenaders come out on the piazza, and one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
laughing jests are thrown at him for keeping the "belle of the
ball away from her proper sphere."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I <i>am</i> selfish," he says. "Let us return to the ball-room,
my love."</p>

<p>"As you please," she answers.</p>

<p>He leads her back and lingers by her side awhile, then it strikes
him that <i>les proprietes</i> do not sanction a man's monopolizing his
wife's company in society. With a sigh he leaves her, and tries
to make himself agreeable to other fair women.</p>

<p>He has hardly left her before the band strikes up "The Beautiful
Blue Danube," and Byron Penn starts up from some remote
corner, from which he has witnessed her return to the ball-room.</p>

<p>"This is our waltz, is it not?" he says, with a tremor of pleasure
in his voice.</p>

<p>A slight flush rises over Bonnibel's cheek.</p>

<p>"I believe it is," she answers; "but if you will not think me
very rude, Mr. Penn, I am going to ask you to excuse me from
it. I am tired and shall dance no more this evening."</p>

<p>"You are very cruel," says the poet, plaintively; "but if you
wish to atone for your injustice you will walk down to the
shore with me and look at the moonlight on the sea, and hear
how delicious the music sounds down there. You can form no
conception of its sweetness when mellowed by a little distance
and blent with the solemn diapason of the waves."</p>

<p>"If you will go and tell my maid to bring me a shawl," she
answers, indifferently, "I will go with you for a minute."</p>

<p>He returns with a fleecy white wrap, and they stroll away
from the "dancers dancing in tune."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p>Colonel Carlyle soon misses his heart's fair queen from the
ball-room, and immediately the whole enchanting scene becomes
a desert in his love-lorn eyes. He glances hither and thither; he
wanders disconsolately around, yet no flitting glimpse of his
snow-maiden rewards his eager eyes. She has vanished as completely
from his sight as if a sunbeam had shone down upon
and dissolved her into a mist.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Bonnibel anywhere?" he inquires of Felise,
meeting her on her partner's arm as he wandered around.</p>

<p>Felise looks up with a low, malicious laugh.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel?" she says. "Oh, yes; she and Byron Penn have
been down on the beach this half hour in the moonlight, composing
sonnets."</p>

<p>Her partner laughs and hurries her on, leaving the anxious
old husband standing in the floor like one dazed. A dozen people
standing around have heard the question and its answer.
They nod and wink at each other, for Colonel Carlyle's patent
jealousy has begun to make him a laughing stock. After a moment
he recollects himself and turns away. People wonder if
he will go out and confront the sentimental pair, and a few
couples, on curiosity bent, stroll out to watch his proceedings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
They are rewarded directly, for he comes out and takes his
way down the shore.</p>

<p>Felise's assertion of a half an hour is merely a pleasant fiction.
It has not been ten minutes since she left the house on the arm
of the young poet. They are standing on the beach looking out
at the glorious sea, and the young man whose soul is so deeply
imbued with poetry that he can think and speak of nothing
else, has been telling her what a sweet poem is "Lucille," Owen
Meredith's latest. He repeats a few lines, and the girl inclines
her head and tries to be attentive.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O, being of beauty and bliss! seen and known<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the depths of my heart, and possessed there alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My days know thee not, and my lips name thee never,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thy place in my poor life is vacant forever,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We have met, we have parted, no more is recorded<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In my annals on earth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The pretty lines have a more attentive listener than Bonnibel.
Her husband has come up softly and unnoticed. He sees the
graceful head graciously inclined, hears the lines that Byron
Penn has, unconsciously to himself, made the vehicle for expressing
his own sentiments, and his heart quakes with fury. He
strides before them, white and stern.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carlyle," he says, in low, stern accents, "will you come
with me?"</p>

<p>The young wife lifts her drooping head with a start and sees
him standing before her, wan, white and haggard, quite a different
man from the enraptured lover who had kissed and praised
her but a little while ago.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;oh, dear me&mdash;has anything happened, Colonel Carlyle?
Are you ill?" she falters, in her innocent unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me?" he repeats, grinding his teeth in a
fury.</p>

<p>"Certainly," she says, thinking that something dreadful must
have happened surely, and simply saying, "You will excuse me,
Mr. Penn," she bows and turns away on her husband's arm.</p>

<p>The handsome young fellow looks after them blankly.</p>

<p>"Upon my word," he exclaims, "what a furious, uncalled-for
outbreak of jealousy! So that's what it is to be an old man's darling,
is it? Truly an enviable position for such a peerless angel."</p>

<p>He throws himself down on the beach, to the detriment of his
immaculate evening costume, and resigns himself to some rather
melancholy musings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bonnibel, as she walks away, again asks, with
sweet unconsciousness:</p>

<p>"<i>Has</i> anything happened, Colonel Carlyle?"</p>

<p>"Let us go to your private parlor; I will tell you there," he
answers, coldly.</p>

<p>Inside that safe retreat they confront each other in momentary
silence, Bonnibel anxious, troubled, and totally unconscious,
Colonel Carlyle pale with anger and wild, unreasoning jealousy,
his brain on fire with contending passions that have been seething
there ever since Felise's consummate art had been employed
to torture him this evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now you will tell me?" she inquires, standing before him
with loosely-clasped hands, the fleecy drapery falling from her
shoulders, the fairest vision his eyes ever rested upon.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel, you surely do not pretend to be ignorant that you
have given me cause for offense?" he exclaims, hoarsely.</p>

<p>Her blue eyes dilate; she retreats a step with genuine surprise
depicted on her face. Then she remembered her promise about
waltzing.</p>

<p>"Surely, there is some misunderstanding," she answers, slowly.
"I assure you, sir, that I have not waltzed any more since you
asked me not to do so."</p>

<p>"You have done worse, much worse!" he exclaims, passionately,
"and your affectation of innocence must certainly be feigned.
No woman in her senses could be oblivious to the fact that your
open flirtation with that silly rhymester, Byron Penn, is simply
scandalous."</p>

<p>In his excitement he characterizes her offense in terms more
forcible than true. She is dumb with astonishment for a moment,
then she walks straight up to him, a blaze of color rushing
over her face and neck, while her eyes flash lightning scorn
upon him.</p>

<p>"This to me!" she exclaims, her girlish voice ringing with passion
and resentment. "Such an accusation to Harry Vere's
daughter! Oh! for shame! How dare you!"</p>

<p>"You provoked it yourself," he answers, retreating before her,
for her little hands were clenched wildly as if she would strike
him down to earth; "I gave you my honored name to wear&mdash;a
name as proud as your father's&mdash;and you have dragged it through
the mire of a moonlight flirtation with a dandy, an idiot."</p>

<p>"It is false," she answers, proudly, "I never flirted in my life,
I should not know how to do it. And there was no harm in my
short walk down to the shore with Mr. Penn. No one could
make harm of it except a man blinded by jealousy!"</p>

<p>A glimmer of the truth had begun to dawn upon her. It angered
him bitterly to know that she had detected his weakness.</p>

<p>"I have been blinded by many things," he answers, furiously.
"I was blinded by your beautiful face before I married you, and
could not see that you had never received the proper training
and education to fit you for the position to which I elevated you.
My eyes have been opened by your recent conduct, and I find
you simply an unformed child, utterly ignorant how to maintain
your dignity as my wife!"</p>

<p>Word for word he is going over the specious sophistries of
Felise, but he is utterly unconscious of the fact. He has been
merely a pliant tool in her artful hands, but he believes that he
has found out all these facts for himself, and he asserts them with
a perfect conviction of truth.</p>

<p>For Bonnibel stands listening in stunned silence to his vehement
rhodomontade. She has walked away from him a little
way, and stands clinging to the back of a chair, as if to save herself
from falling. The angry flush has died out of her face, and
she looks marble-cold, and white even to her lips. As he pauses,
she speaks in low, resentful accents:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Colonel Carlyle, you are the first man who has ever offered
me an insult!"</p>

<p>"An insult!" he exclaims. "Do you call the truth an insult?
You talk like a child and act like a child, Bonnibel. I see no
other resource before me than to put you at school and keep you
there until you learn the necessary amenities of social life which
your uncle's blind indulgence aided and abetted you in ignoring."</p>

<p>"Send <i>me</i>&mdash;a married woman&mdash;to school&mdash;like a child!" she
says, staring at him blankly.</p>

<p>"Why not? You are quite young enough yet," he answers,
moodily. "Two years at a convent school in Paris would give
you the training and finish you lack at present."</p>

<p>"I assure you, sir, that my education has not been so totally
neglected as your words imply," she answers from the depths of
the arm-chair into which she has wearily fallen. "My Uncle
Francis, though he loved me too well to send me away from
him to school, always provided me with competent governesses,
and if my training does not do them credit it is my own fault,
not his; so I beg that you will not needlessly reflect on his
memory."</p>

<p>He was silent a moment, pacing restlessly up and down the
floor. An unconscious pathos in her words had stung him into
reflection. "My Uncle Francis loved me too well to send me
away from him," has touched a responsive chord in his own heart.
Her uncle had loved her like that, yet he, her husband, bound to
her by the dearest tie on earth, could talk of sending her away
from him like a naughty child that, having disobeyed, must be
punished for its fault.</p>

<p>"<i>Could</i> I do it?" he asked himself, suddenly. "I love her as
my own life, though her childish follies drive me mad with jealousy.
I am growing old&mdash;could I lose her out of my life two
precious years when my span of existence may be so short? No,
no, fool that I was to threaten her so; I will retract it if I can
without compromising my dignity."</p>

<p>He paused before her and said abruptly:</p>

<p>"I understand from your words then, Bonnibel, that you refuse
your consent to my proposed plan?"</p>

<p>To his surprise and confusion she lifted her head with a proud,
stag-like motion, and said icily:</p>

<p>"<i>Au contraire</i>, sir, I think well of it, and fully agree with you
that I need more training and polish to fit me for the exalted
position I occupy as your wife!"</p>

<p>The fine, delicate irony of her tone could not fail to strike him
keenly.</p>

<p>He tried to ignore it as he said in a voice that betrayed nothing
of his conflicting emotions:</p>

<p>"My proposed course meets with your full approval, then,
madam?"</p>

<p>She inclines her head with stately grace.</p>

<p>"I cannot think of anything at present, Colonel Carlyle, that
would please me so well as a few years at a Parisian school such
as you mentioned."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is only too glad to have an opportunity of separating
herself from me," he thinks, bitterly; but aloud he answers
coldly, "So be it; I shall be happy to meet your wishes."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p>It is barely midnight and the mirth and merriment are at their
hight down-stairs. Bonnibel hears the sound of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The violin, flute and bassoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the dancers dancing in tune."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>through all her interview with Colonel Carlyle, but when it is
ended she does not return to the ball-room. She leaves him with
a cold good-night, and retires to her own room.</p>

<p>Lucy, her maid, starts up drowsily from her easy-chair as she
enters.</p>

<p>"You here, Lucy?" she says. "I told you not to stay up for
me. You should not break your rest staying up night after
night like this."</p>

<p>"Lor', Miss Bonnibel, I have had as comfortable a snooze in
your arm-chair as if I had been tucked into my bed," Lucy answers
good-naturedly. "Don't you go for to worry over me
staying up. I kin stand it if you kin."</p>

<p>Her mistress stands in the center of the room, her eyes shining,
her white hands tearing at the diamond necklace about her
throat.</p>

<p>"Take it off, Lucy," she cries out impatiently. "It hurts me,
it chokes me!"</p>

<p>Lucy hastens to obey, but starts back as she sees the wild, white
face of the hapless girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, me!" she exclaims, "you look like a ghost, you are that
white. Are you sick, Miss Bonnibel? Let me get you something
to take&mdash;some wine, or something?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I wish nothing," she answers, impatiently. "Only undress
me, Lucy, and help me to bed. I am very tired&mdash;that is
all."</p>

<p>She sits quite still while Lucy removes the jewels that shine
about her, the white satin slippers, the elegant dress, and brings
the snowy night-dress instead. Then as the maid kneels down
and buttons the delicate robe, Bonnibel, glancing down, sees her
eyes full of tears and her full lip quivering.</p>

<p>"Lucy," she says, in surprise, "what is it? What has grieved
you?"</p>

<p>Lucy starts as if frightened at being detected.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, ma'am," she says; "it's for you I grieve. You
are that changed that I can't bear it! Here I have been your
maid since you was a little girl of twelve, and how happy you
used to be before the master died&mdash;now for goin' on a year I've
never seen a real smile on your face. Something troubles you
all the time. Can't I help you? Can't I do something for you?"</p>

<p>The humble, patient fidelity of the girl touches Bonnibel to the
heart, it is so seldom that an honest, heartfelt word of kindness
falls on her ears. Impulsively she bends and puts her lily white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
hand into the strong clasp of the girl sitting humbly at her feet,
looking up at her with tear-filled eyes.</p>

<p>"Lucy, my poor girl," she says, plaintively, "I believe you are the
only true friend I have on earth!"</p>

<p>"Then can't I help you, Miss Bonnibel?" cried Lucy, feeling
that the words of her young mistress are too true for her to dispute
them. "Something troubles you&mdash;can't I help you to be
happier?"</p>

<p>A sigh&mdash;hopeless, passionate, profound&mdash;drifts across the lips of
the listener.</p>

<p>"No no, my poor, kind girl," she answers; "no one can help
me&mdash;I must bear my own cross&mdash;no one can carry it for me! Only
stay with me, Lucy, and love me always&mdash;I have so few to love
me&mdash;and I shall feel better when I can see that your kind heart
sympathizes with me."</p>

<p>"I'll never leave you, my dear mistress," sobs the girl; "I'll
never forget to love every hair of your innocent head."</p>

<p>She kisses the little hand Bonnibel has given her reverently and
tenderly, as if it were some precious thing.</p>

<p>"Lucy, I am going to test your fidelity," says the girl, drearily.
"I am going away to Europe next week. Will you go with me?"</p>

<p>Lucy stares open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"To Yurrup, Miss Bonnibel! Away off to them furrin parts?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lucy, away off there. Does your courage fail you?" her
mistress inquires, with a slight, sad smile.</p>

<p>"No, no, ma'am. I don't like furrin people much; but I'll go
to the ends of the earth with you!" is the resolute reply.</p>

<p>"Your devotion shall not be taxed that far, Lucy. We will go
to France."</p>

<p>"That heathen land," exclaims Lucy, "where the monseers eats
frogs and snakes?"</p>

<p>Bonnibel cannot repress a smile at the girl's quick gesture of
disgust.</p>

<p>"You will like the French people better, I hope, when you
stay among them two years, for I shall probably stay in Paris
that long. I am going to school there, Lucy. You know that I
have never been to school in my life, and my governesses were not
strict enough with me. There are many things I do not know
yet, that one moving in society I frequent should know. So
I am going to learn something yet. It is never too late to mend,
you know."</p>

<p>Lucy looks up, her eyes growing round with surprise.</p>

<p>"Lor', Miss Bonnibel, I never heard of a married woman going
to school in my life."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you never heard of a married woman so untutored
as I am," her young mistress returns, somewhat bitterly; "anyway,
I am determined to go to school and learn something.
But I cannot do without a maid, and I will take you, if you will
go."</p>

<p>"That I certainly will, Miss Bonnibel," said Lucy, emphatically.</p>

<p>"Very well, Colonel Carlyle and I will start to New York to-morrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
to make preparations for our trip. See that the trunks
are all packed, Lucy."</p>

<p>"I will, ma'am. They shall be ready, never fear."</p>

<p>She rises and looks wistfully at the little white figure in the
chair, resting its dimpled chin in the curve of one pink palm, the
golden head bent wearily.</p>

<p>"Sha'n't I get you something? Indeed, you look ill," she implores.</p>

<p>"Nothing, Lucy. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night, ma'am," Lucy responds, going away rather reluctantly.</p>

<p>Bonnibel makes no move to retire when Lucy has gone. The
little white bed awaits her, tempting to repose by its daintiness
and coolness, but she does not look toward it; only sits still as
Lucy left her, with her face bowed on her hand.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle has gone back to the ball-room again, trying to
steel his heart against the upbraidings of his conscience. He
moves among the revelers pale and <i>distrait</i>, yet still trying to
bear his part in the gaieties lest people should whisper that he is
unhappy, and fearful that some one may read the secret of his
jealousy and cruelty to his beautiful darling.</p>

<p>Curious glances follow him, whispers breathe the story that he
fain would conceal, every eye notes Bonnibel's absence.</p>

<p>They shrug their shoulders and tell each other in confidence
that Colonel Carlyle is a perfect Bluebeard, and has banished his
wife from the festal scene because he is jealous of Byron Penn.</p>

<p>And the music and the dancing go on until daylight warns the
gay ones to flee from that too true light that reveals their weariness
and haggardness so plainly.</p>

<p>But the ball is long since over for Bonnibel. Lucy finds her as
she left her, curled up in the great arm-chair, sleeping like a grieved
child, with the trace of tears on her cheek.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p>Long Branch is electrified next day by the sudden departure
of the Carlyles for New York.</p>

<p>Surprise and wonder run high, and the curious ones seek Felise,
thinking that she, if any one, must be acquainted with the whys
and wherefores.</p>

<p>But Felise is rather reticent on the subject.</p>

<p>"I will tell you all I know," she says, with a pretty affectation
of frankness. "That is not much. The Carlyles are going
abroad next week and the colonel is going to put his wife at a
convent school in Paris to finish her education and perfect herself
in music. He told me that much this morning, and I did not
ask him why he proposed taking such a singular step."</p>

<p>"You thought him so crazed by jealousy that he could hardly
account for his whims in a rational manner, eh?" inquired one.</p>

<p>"It is monstrous!" says another. "Why, the girl was as
finished and elegant in her manners as mortal could be. It were
impossible to add another charm to her."</p>

<p>While Byron Penn quoted with enthusiasm:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To smooth the ice; or add another hue<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unto the rainbow; or with taper light<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To seek the beauteous eye of Heaven to garnish,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Were wasteful and ridiculous excess."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was a nine days' wonder, and then it was over. People
voted Colonel Carlyle a bear and a Bluebeard, and his lovely
young bride a victim and martyr. They said that he was secluding
her from the world because he was too jealous for the light
of Heaven to shine upon her.</p>

<p>The young poet indited some charming verses for his favorite
magazine: "To Those Blue Eyes Across the Sea," and then the
gossip began to die out, and new subjects engrossed society's
mind.</p>

<p>Months rolled on, and the Carlyle <i>eclaircissement</i> was almost
forgotten, or at least but seldom named, even by those who had
been the most interested at first.</p>

<p>But Felise was jubilant.</p>

<p>"Mother, you see what I can do," she said, with a wicked
laugh. "The honeymoon is barely over, yet I have thrown sand
in the old man's eyes and parted him from his darling for two
whole years."</p>

<p>"Felise, how did you accomplish it?" Mrs. Arnold inquired
curiously.</p>

<p>"That is my secret," she answered, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"You might share it with me," her mother said, reproachfully.
"I never have secrets from you, my dear."</p>

<p>"I only used a little tact and humbug, mother&mdash;just a word
dropped in season here and there&mdash;yet the seed I sowed has
brought forth an abundant harvest. I have driven him nearly
mad with jealousy and doubt and suspicion; I put that scheme of
sending Bonnibel to school into his mind. And yet so blinded is
he by his jealousy that he does not dream of my complicity in
the matter, and he will always blame himself for the everlasting
alienation that will exist between them."</p>

<p>"You had your revenge sooner than I thought you would.
You are a clever girl, Felise," Mrs. Arnold said, admiringly.</p>

<p>"It is but begun," Felise answered, moodily. "If time spares
the old man until Bonnibel comes out of her school I will wring
his heart even more deeply than I have already done. I bide my
time."</p>

<p>Her mother, cruel and vindictive as she was herself, looked at
her in wonder.</p>

<p>"Why, it seems to me that you have already deeply avenged
yourself," she said.</p>

<p>"Hell has no fury like a woman scorned!" Felise exclaimed, repeating
her favorite text. "Be patient, mother, and you shall
yet see what a woman scorned can do."</p>

<p>"What does Colonel Carlyle propose to do with himself while
his wife is immured in her convent?" asked Mrs. Arnold.</p>

<p>"He talks of a trip around the world. He affects to be very
fond of travel now. But I could see while he talked to me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the old fool repented his intention and would retract it if he
could."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he may do so yet."</p>

<p>"No, he will not. He is too proud and stubborn to do so voluntarily,
and I think that Bonnibel has acquiesced so readily in
the plan that he can find no loop-hole of escape from it. She is as
proud as he is; besides, she does not love him, and his unreasoning
harshness has rendered her perfectly reckless. She will go
to the school, if only to break his heart."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will die of grief, Felise, or disappointment, and
then she will be left a wealthy young widow," cautions Mrs.
Arnold.</p>

<p>"No danger," sneers Felise, cynically. "Men have died and
worms have eaten them, but not for <i>love</i>, as the immortal
Shakespeare says, mother. I do not anticipate such a contingency.
The old dotard has buried two partners and not succumbed
to the pangs of bereavement yet. It is possible he may
live to plant the weeping willow over his little white-faced dove."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. She has never seemed over strong since her illness
last summer."</p>

<p>"She has been grieving over the loss of Leslie Dane," Felise
answered, carelessly.</p>

<p>She goes to the piano, strikes a few chords, and gets up again,
wandering about the room restlessly. There is a marked fitfulness
and unrest in her every movement, and her eyes flash and
roll about in their sockets in a way that troubles her mother.</p>

<p>"Felise, do you sleep well at night?" she inquires, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Why should I not?" the girl asks, turning her head away.</p>

<p>"I do not know; but there is a haggardness and restlessness
about you as if you didn't sleep much. I fancy you are getting
nervous and wakeful brooding over this revenge of yours. Your
face has grown wan and your eyes quite wild. Take care of
yourself or you will lose your beauty."</p>

<p>"Never mind, mother; when we go to Paris next year I will
go to one of those wonderful women there and have myself made
beautiful forever."</p>

<p>"To Paris? Do you really mean it, Felise? I thought you said
the last time we went abroad that you were tired of it and never
meant to go again."</p>

<p>"I have changed my mind, mother. That is the privilege of
the fair sex, you know."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have some motive in this change of mind,
Felise."</p>

<p>"Yes. I have. I want to be on hand when Mrs. Carlyle
comes forth from her finishing school. I have a fancy to see her
after the polishing process is completed."</p>

<p>She laughs softly to herself as if something pleasant has occurred
to her.</p>

<p>"Well, well, have your own way about it, my dear&mdash;you always
do. But I wish you could forget the Carlyles and enjoy
life better. We have everything to make it enjoyable, and if you
wanted to marry, why you could buy almost anyone you wanted
with our wealth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"I could not buy Colonel Carlyle, mother, though I wanted
him very much. He is the wealthiest man I know of anywhere."</p>

<p>"You do not need to marry for wealth, my daughter; we have
enough of our own."</p>

<p>Felise did not answer. She was absorbed in thought. Nothing
Mrs. Arnold could say made the least impression on her mind.</p>

<p>She was wedded to one idea, and as the weeks and months rolled
by it only took a firmer hold on her feelings.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p>"Madam Carlyle, monsieur, your husband, awaits you in the
<i>salon</i>."</p>

<p>The tall, beautiful blonde, practicing a difficult sonata at the
piano, pauses a moment and suffers her white hands to rest idly
on the keys.</p>

<p>"Colonel Carlyle, did you say, madam?" she inquires calmly.</p>

<p>The dignified head of the Parisian school bows in assent, and
stands awaiting her pupil's pleasure. The latter rises slowly,
folds her music together, restores it to the proper place and turns
to leave the music-room.</p>

<p>"You will wish to make some changes in your dress, of course,"
the lady superior blandly asserts.</p>

<p>Madam Carlyle gives a glance downward at her dress of dark
blue cashmere. It is made with almost nun-like simplicity, and
fits her rounded, graceful form to perfection. The neck and
sleeves are finished with frills and fine lace, and there is not an
ornament about her except the rings on her tapering fingers. She
does not need ornament. She is rarely, peerlessly beautiful with
her fair flower-face and luxuriant crown of golden hair.</p>

<p>"It is not necessary," she answers. "Colonel Carlyle is perhaps
impatient."</p>

<p>There is a delicate-veiled sarcasm in the words barely perceptible
to the trained hearing of the listener. With that simple speech
she turns and glides from the room, leaving the lady superior
gazing after her in some surprise.</p>

<p>"They say that we in France make <i>mariages de convenance</i>,"
she murmurs in French (which we will spare our readers); "but
surely the Americans must do likewise. That old man and that
fair young girl&mdash;surely it is the union of winter and summer.
After two years' absence she goes to him as coolly as an iceberg."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Carlyle has glided down the long hall, opened
the door of the reception-room with a steady hand, and stepped
across the threshold.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel!" exclaims a voice, trembling with rapture and
emotion&mdash;"my darling wife!"</p>

<p>His arms are about her, his lips touch hers.</p>

<p>After a moment she gently disengages herself and looks up in
his face.</p>

<p>"Colonel Carlyle," she exclaims, involuntarily, "how changed
you are!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten years instead of two seem to have gone over his head.</p>

<p>A look of age and weakness has grown into his face, his erect
form has acquired a perceptible stoop; yet a look of disappointment
flashes into his eyes at her words.</p>

<p>"It is only the fatigue of travel," he answers, quickly. "I
have been a great wanderer since we parted, my dear, and the
weariness of travel is still upon me. But as soon as I get rested
and recuperated I shall look quite like myself again."</p>

<p>"I hope so," she answers, politely. "Pray resume your seat
sir."</p>

<p>He looks at her a little wistfully as she seats herself some distance
from him.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel, are you glad to see me again?" he asks, gently.</p>

<p>She looks up, startled, and hesitating what to say to this
point-blank question.</p>

<p>He sees the struggle in a moment, and adds, quickly and a
little sadly:</p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear, you need not answer. I see you have
not forgotten my harshness in the past, and you are not prepared
with an answer that would make me happy. But, my
darling, you must learn forgetfulness of those things that alienated
you from me, for I shall bend every effort now to the one
object of making you happy. I have come to take you away
with me, Bonnibel."</p>

<p>A slight, almost impalpable, shiver runs through her at the
words, and she smothers a faint sigh.</p>

<p>She will be very sorry to leave this haven of peace in which
she has rested securely the last two years. She has grown fond
of her quiet life among the "passionless, pale-cold" nuns of the
convent, and is loth to break its repose by going back to the jar
and fret of life with her jealous husband. She wishes that she
might stay in the convent all her life.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to return at once to the United States, sir?"
she inquires, being at a loss for something to say.</p>

<p>"Not yet, unless you particularly desire it. I want you to see
something of life in the gay French Capital&mdash;'dear, delightful
Paris,' as we Americans call it. I have rented an elegant <i>chateau</i>
and furnished it in handsome style, according to what I fancied
your taste would prefer; have engaged a retinue of servants; and
there is a lovely garden of roses; in short, the home is ready, and
only awaits its mistress. I have tried to arrange everything as
you would like it."</p>

<p>"Thank you; you are very kind," she murmurs, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>"The next thing," he goes on, "is to take you to Worth, where
you may order an outfit as handsome as a queen's, if you choose.
And jewels&mdash;well, you shall have as many and as costly ones as
you like."</p>

<p>"I have enough jewels, I think," she answers. "There are the
pearls Uncle Francis gave me; then my wedding-gift&mdash;the diamonds."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut; you will need many more when you are fairly
launched on the tide of gay society here. You will see women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
fairly loaded with jewels&mdash;you must not have less than they. Not
but that you are beautiful enough to dispense with extraneous
ornament, but I wish you to outshine all others in adornment as
well as in beauty."</p>

<p>The long lashes droop over her cheeks a little sadly as he talks.
So these are the things with which she is to fill her life&mdash;society,
dress, jewels, fashion. A long life, too, perhaps, for she is barely
twenty-one now. For other women there may be love and happiness&mdash;for
her nothing but the gilded pleasures that wealth can
purchase. Ah, well, and with a start she remembers Mrs. Arnold's
threat and her weak subjugation by it&mdash;these are the things
for which she sold herself to the old man sitting yonder. She
made the bargain herself, and now she must abide by it. She is
a fettered slave, but at least her bonds are golden ones.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," she answers, trying hard to be cordial
and grateful for his generosity. "I do not know how to thank
you for your munificence, sir."</p>

<p>"I will tell you," he answers, quickly. "Try to like me a little,
Bonnibel. Once I dreamed of winning your love; but things
went wrong and I&mdash;I&mdash;perhaps I was too harsh with the bonny
bird I had caught&mdash;so I came near earning your hatred instead.
But that was so long ago. You will try to forgive me and like
me just a little now, my wife."</p>

<p>The pathos of his words, his aged, weary looks touch a tender
chord in her young heart, and thaw out a little of the icy
crust of reserve that has been freezing around it these two years.</p>

<p>She rises impulsively and walks over to him, putting her delicate
hand, warm with youth and health, into his cold, white,
trembling one.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I will try," she says, earnestly. "Only be kind to
me, and do not frighten me with your jealous fancies, and I will
like you very much indeed!"</p>

<p>He kisses the little hand with the ardor of a boyish lover, feeling
his heart beat warm and youthful still at her gently-spoken
words.</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks, my angel!" he exclaims. "Your words
have made me very happy. I will try to curb my jealous temper
and merit your sweet regard. And now, my dearest, how soon
can you accompany me? I do not want to go away without
you."</p>

<p>"You wish me to go at once&mdash;to-day?" she stammers, drawing
back ever so slightly.</p>

<p>"To-day&mdash;at once," he answers. "I have wearied for a sight
of you so long, my wife, that I cannot let you go again. I want
you to put on a carriage costume at once, and I will take you to
Worth's, and from thence to the <i>chateau</i>."</p>

<p>"But my maid&mdash;and my trunks," she urges, in dismay.</p>

<p>"Tell your maid to pack your trunks and we will send for
them this evening, and her also. By the way, who is your maid?
Have you a competent one?" he inquires.</p>

<p>"You remember Lucy&mdash;the girl who came over with me from
New York?" she says.</p>

<p>He frowns slightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, yes; but she will not suit you now, dear. You must let
her go, and secure a skillful French maid."</p>

<p>"Let Lucy go&mdash;the faithful creature!" For the first time her
lip quivers. "Oh, no, I cannot part with Lucy. She has been
my attendant ever since I was a child, and is the only link that
is left to me out of my old life."</p>

<p>"Keep her with you still, then, but secure a French maid also,
and let Lucy hold a sinecure."</p>

<p>"It would break her heart, Colonel Carlyle, to depose her from
her post as my chief helper. Besides, though she is rather illiterate,
the girl has real talent and taste in her vocation. Pray do
not ask me to give her up."</p>

<p>"As you please, my dear. But now go and make your adieux
to the lady superior and your friends here, and prepare to accompany
me to your new home," said the colonel, with slight impatience,
for he already felt his dominant passion, jealousy, rising
within him at Bonnibel's openly-expressed preference for her
maid. Old or young, male or female, he could not feel contented
that anyone but himself should hold a place in his young wife's
heart.</p>

<p>She went away and remained what seemed a long time to the
impatient old man. She came back with slightly-flushed cheeks
and a mist in her sea-blue eyes, attended by the superior of the
convent.</p>

<p>With a brief and gentle farewell to her, Bonnibel entered the
carriage with her husband.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p>"Hurrah, Leslie!"</p>

<p>"Well, Carl!"</p>

<p>"Our pictures are sold!"</p>

<p>"What pictures?"</p>

<p>"What pictures?" mimicking the indifferent tone. "Oh! how
indifferent we are! yet a year ago how blessed were the feet of
the messenger who brought such tidings! Success falls upon you,
my boy. Now with me a ready sale is quite an event. Of
course I meant the pictures we sent to Paris!"</p>

<p>The same old studio at Rome into which we looked three years
ago, and the same two artists we saw then. Carl Muller had
just entered, waving an open letter over his head.</p>

<p>The gay, mercurial German looked as boyishly handsome as
ever, as though time had forgotten him. Not so with Leslie Dane,
who stood beside a half-finished picture, critically regarding it.
He was handsomer than ever, as though the subtle hand of a
sculptor had been at work upon his features chiseling the fine
Greek outlines into rarer perfection and delicacy. A few lines
of thought and care added rather than detracted from the interest
with which one turned a second time to look at his face. The
full lips half shaded by the dark mustache had lost a little of the
almost womanly sweetness of the past and acquired a sterner
curve. Into the dark eyes there had crept a gleam of brooding
sadness, and a few silver threads shone in the clustering locks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
about his white brow. His last three years had made their mark
upon him in many subtle changes.</p>

<p>"I could have told you that yesterday, Carl," he said, smiling,
"but you were out when my letter came, and I was so busy over
my picture here that I forgot it when you returned."</p>

<p>"The agent wrote to you first then," said Carl. "He might
have had the courtesy to drop me a line at the same time."</p>

<p>"Do not blame him too much, Carl," said Leslie Dane. "He
was in a hurry about writing to me because he had a letter to inclose
from the purchaser of the pictures."</p>

<p>"Another commission, you lucky dog!" exclaimed Carl Muller.</p>

<p>"It amounts to that, I suppose. He wants me to go to Paris
and paint his wife's portrait. If I will not go to Paris he will
come to Rome."</p>

<p>"If the mountain will not go to Mahomet, then Mahomet
must go to the mountain," said Carl.</p>

<p>"Something that way," said Leslie, carelessly.</p>

<p>"You will accept, of course. The old fellow paid such an extravagant
price for the pictures that another commission might
be a temptation even to you who have lately been surfeited with
success."</p>

<p>"The money certainly might be an object, but I think I shall
refuse," was the abrupt reply.</p>

<p>"Refuse!" exclaimed Carl, in surprise, "and why, if I may
ask?"</p>

<p>"The man is an American."</p>

<p>"So are you," cried the German, surprised at the dark frown
that darkened on Leslie's brow. "Is that a disgrace?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not. Yet I will have nothing to do with my
countrymen," said the artist, sternly.</p>

<p>Carl gave vent to a low whistle.</p>

<p>"Ye gods! An American&mdash;born under the shadow of the
eagle's wing of liberty, a citizen of a land the most patriotic upon
earth&mdash;coolly repudiating his country! I never expected to see
such a novel sight under the sun!"</p>

<p>"You mistake me, Carl," said Leslie Dane, a little vexed. "I
do not repudiate my native land. I revere her as the noblest
country upon earth, but I am from henceforth an exile, self-expatriated
from her shores, and I do not wish to meet anyone
who can recall memories I would fain forget."</p>

<p>"You are a strange fellow, Leslie, I cannot understand your
moods."</p>

<p>"You do not? Shall I explain, Carl? Listen, then."</p>

<p>Carl looked up into the dark face with its look of proud grief
mingled with bitterness.</p>

<p>"No, no; forgive my levity," he said; "I would not intrude
upon your secret, dear friend. Let it rest."</p>

<p>"It does not matter," said Leslie, his deep voice full of pain.
"I will tell you, Carl. It is only this: One woman in that fair
land where I was born has played me false and ruined my life.
I hate and shun all Americans for her sake!"</p>

<p>He took up his brush and went to work at his picture without
another word. Carl was silent also; he was recalling that episode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of three years ago when Leslie in his wild outbreak had
painted out the portrait of his fair, false-hearted love.</p>

<p>"So he has not forgotten her," he thought; "and yet he has
never breathed another word of her until to-day. Ah! she will
never know what a true and noble heart she cast away."</p>

<p>He sat still awhile thinking profoundly, and referring to his
letter now and then with ever-increasing pride in the lucrative
sale of his picture, for Carl was a lazy fellow, and though he commenced
numbers of things seldom had patience to finish them.
Consequently a completed work and its ready sale had all the
charm of novelty to him.</p>

<p>"I say," he said, breaking the silence that had brooded as long
as he could bear it, and returning to the charge upon his friend,
"old fellow, it's a shame you should refuse such a profitable commission
for a scruple I must say is not worthy of you. Do accept
it, Leslie. This old fellow&mdash;let me see"&mdash;referring again to his
letter&mdash;"Carlyle his name is&mdash;Colonel Carlyle&mdash;need not trouble
you much with the sight of his obnoxious face, and the old lady&mdash;Favart
says he is an old man, so of course she is an old lady&mdash;need
only give you a few sittings. They would not trouble you
long, and you need not think of them as Americans at all.
Simply regard the sitter as your model, and think no more
about it."</p>

<p>Leslie Dane did not answer, but the slight smile that played
around his lips showed that he had been an attentive listener to
Carl's admonition.</p>

<p>"You know," resumed Carl, seeing that Leslie would not answer,
"we have been promising ourselves a trip to Paris for ever
so long. I see no chance so suitable as the present when I have
this pot of money to spend, and when you might so agreeably
combine business with pleasure in the execution of this portrait
and the enjoyment of all the pleasures of Paris. Recollect, you
would be fairly lionized there."</p>

<p>"I do not fancy being lionized," said Leslie Dane, grimly.</p>

<p>"Do you not! Now, I should enjoy it above all things. But
since I am not apt to have that honor I should enjoy following in
your wake and taking all the glories second-hand. I should be
sure to get a little of the honor reflected on me, for though I am
not the rose, you know I have lived near it."</p>

<p>Leslie Dane looked up with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>"Confess now, Carl," he said, "that nothing will content you
but to get away and spend the gold you have earned. All your
flattery and sophistry leads to this&mdash;that you are wild for a companion
to aid and abet you in spending the money that is burning
a hole in your pocket this minute."</p>

<p>"Somehow the gold does seem to burn through my pockets,"
said Carl, reflectively. "But, tra, la, what is it good for but to
buy pleasure?"</p>

<p>He began to hum a few bars of a German song with a gay refrain.</p>

<p>"Come, come, get to your work," exclaimed the other.
"Your signal success with your last work should stimulate you
to renewed efforts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"So it will," affirmed Carl; "but not to-day. I feel so giddy
over my good news that I could not work to-day. I should
hardly know how to mix my colors. I feel as lazy, shiftless and
good-natured as the Italian lazzaroni out in the sunshine."</p>

<p>Leslie Dane gave a little sigh as he looked at his happy companion.
Nothing ever seemed to ruffle the gay current of his
good nature. His temperament was an enviable one.</p>

<p>"Carl, did you ever have a sweetheart?" Leslie asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Sweethearts&mdash;yes, a score of them," laughed Carl. "More
Gretchens, Madchens, and Anitas than you could count on your
fingers. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Only for curiosity. I thought you could not be so care-free
and joyous if love had ever come into your life."</p>

<p>"That is according to how we look at love," said the German;
"with you it is all a solemn epic or tragedy. With me it would
be a pretty little poem or a happy song."</p>

<p>Leslie sighed but did not answer.</p>

<p>"Come, now," said the German, "we have wandered from our
subject. Give up your selfishness this once, Leslie, and take a
holiday. Come with me to Paris next week."</p>

<p>Leslie stood silently meditating, and Carl saw that the battle
was almost won.</p>

<p>"Don't hesitate," said he, pushing his advantage. "Indeed you
work too hard, my boy. There is no need of it since you have
forsworn marriage. Take a breathing spell and come with me
to Paris and paint old Mrs. Carlyle's portrait."</p>

<p>Leslie frowned slightly at the words.</p>

<p>"Pray do not mention those people again," he said, in an irritated
tone. "Perhaps I will accompany you to Paris; but I have
no fancy to paint the portrait of a wrinkled old woman."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p>"Confound the impudence of such fellows!" said Colonel
Carlyle, fretfully, as he entered his wife's morning-room.</p>

<p>It was a charming apartment with hangings of pale blue satin
that made a perfect foil to the pearl-fair beauty of Bonnibel.</p>

<p>The chairs and sofas were upholstered in the same rich material;
the carpet was white velvet, sprinkled over with blue forget-me-nots;
the costly white lace curtains were draped over blue satin,
and the bright fire burning in the silver grate shone upon expensive
gilding and delicate bric-a-brac scattered profusely about the
room.</p>

<p>A marble Flora, half buried in flowers, stood in a niche, and
vases of delicate white lilies were on the marble mantel.</p>

<p>The young mistress of all this beauty and wealth so tastefully
combined, as she sat near the fire with an open book, looked like
a gem set in an appropriate shrine, so fair, and pure, and dainty,
was her person and her apparel.</p>

<p>She looked up with a slight smile as her liege lord's fretful
ejaculation fell upon her ears.</p>

<p>"What person has been so unfortunate as to incur your displeasure?"
she inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"The artist of whom I purchased that splendid picture for the
drawing-room&mdash;the last one, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, languidly; "and what has he done now?"</p>

<p>"I wanted him to paint your portrait, you know."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I did not know," she returned.</p>

<p>"Oh no; I believe you did not. I think I failed to mention the
matter to you. Well, he is the greatest artist in Rome&mdash;people
are raving over his pictures. They say he has the most brilliant
genius of his time."</p>

<p>"Is that why you are angry with him?" she asked, with a slight
smile.</p>

<p>"No; oh, no. But I wrote to him and asked him to paint
your portrait. I even offered to take you to Rome if he would
not come to Paris."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"He had the impertinence to send me a cool refusal," said the
colonel, irately.</p>

<p>"He did&mdash;and why?" asked Bonnibel, just a little piqued at the
unknown artist.</p>

<p>"He did not like to paint portraits, he said&mdash;he preferred the
ideal world of art. Did you ever hear of such a cool excuse?"</p>

<p>"We have no right to feel angry with him. He is, of course,
the master of his own actions, and has undoubted right to his
preferences," said Bonnibel, calmly.</p>

<p>But though she spoke so quietly, her womanly vanity was
piqued by the unknown artist's cold refusal "to hand her sweetness
down to fame."</p>

<p>"Who is he? What is his name?" she asked.</p>

<p>The colonel considered a moment.</p>

<p>"I have a wonderful faculty for forgetting names," he said.
"Favart has told me his name several times&mdash;let me see&mdash;I think&mdash;yes,
I am sure&mdash;it is <i>Deane</i>!"</p>

<p>"I should like to see him," she said, "I have always taken a
great deal of interest in artists."</p>

<p>"You will be very apt to see him," said the colonel; "he is in
Paris now&mdash;taking a holiday, Favart says. People are making
quite a fuss over him and his friend&mdash;the artist from whom I
bought the other fine picture, you know. You will be sure to
meet them in society."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" she asked, twirling the leaves of her book
nervously. The mention of artists and pictures always agitated
her strangely. She could not forget the young artist who had
gone to Rome to earn fame and fortune and died so soon. Her
cheek paled with emotion, and her eyes darkened with sadness
under their drooping lashes of golden-brown.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is not a doubt of it," he said. "In fact, I suppose
we shall have to invite them, too, though I do not relish it after
the fellow's incivility. But it is the privilege of greatness to be
crusty, I believe. Anyway, the fashionables are all <i>feting</i> and
lionizing him, so we cannot well slight him. I shall have Monsieur
Favart bring him and his friend to our ball next week.
What do you say, my dear?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Send him a card by all means," she answered, "I am quite
curious to see him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he may repent his refusal when he sees how beautiful
you are, my darling," said the colonel, with a fond, proud
glance into her face. "His ideal world of art, as he calls it, cannot
contain anything more lovely than yourself."</p>

<p>"You flatter me, Colonel Carlyle," she said lightly, but in her
heart she knew that he had spoken truly. She had been afloat
on the whirling tide of fashionable life now for several months,
and praises and adulation had followed her everywhere. The
gay Parisians went mad over her pure blonde loveliness. They
said she was the most beautiful and refined woman in Paris, as
well as the most cold and pure. She had begun to take a certain
pleasure in the gaieties of the world and in the homage that followed
her wherever she moved. These were the empty husks
on which she had to feed her heart's hunger, and she was trying
to find them sweet.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle's baleful jealousy had lain dormant or concealed
even since he had taken his wife from school.</p>

<p>True, his arch-enemy, Felise Herbert, was in Paris, but for
some reason of her own she had not as yet laid any serious pitfall
for his unwary feet.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was only playing with him as the cat does with
the little mouse before she ruthlessly murders it; perhaps Bonnibel's
icy-cold manner and studied reserve to all made it harder to
excite the old soldier's ever ready suspicion.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, life flowed on calmly if not happily to the
colonel and his young wife.</p>

<p>They met Mrs. Arnold and her daughter frequently in their
fashionable rounds, they invited them to their house, and received
invitations in return, but though the colonel was cordial,
his wife was cold and proud to the two women who had been so
cruel to her and driven her into this unhappy marriage with a
man old enough to be her grandfather. She could not forgive
them for that cruel deed.</p>

<p>"I bide my time," Felise said to her mother one day when
they were discussing the Carlyles. "I am giving her a little
taste of the world's pleasures. I want her to fall in love with
this life she is leading here. She will be tempted by its enticements
and forget her coldness and prudishness. Then I shall
strike."</p>

<p>"She is very circumspect," said Mrs. Arnold. "They say she
is a model of virtue and beautiful wifely obedience."</p>

<p>"The higher she soars now the lower her fall shall be!" exclaimed
the relentless girl, with her low, reckless laugh,
"mother, I shall not fail of my revenge!"</p>

<p>Ah! Felise Herbert! The coils of fate are tightening around
you like a deadly serpent while you exult in your wickedness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>The gay, pleasure-loving Parisians were on the <i>qui vive</i> for Mrs.
Carlyle's masquerade ball, for it was everywhere conceded that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
her entertainments were the most <i>recherche</i> and delightful in the
whole city. Colonel Carlyle spared neither pains nor expense to
render them so.</p>

<p>In his laudable desire to further Bonnibel's happiness, the colonel
lavished gold like water. He knew no other path to success
than this. He wanted to win her regard, if possible, and his experience
in society had disposed him to believe that the most
potent "open sesame" to a woman's heart was wealth and
power.</p>

<p>How far the colonel's convictions were true, or how ably he
might have succeeded in the darling wish of his heart, had things
gone well, we shall never know, for the frail superstructure of
his happiness, builded on the sand, was destined to be thrown
down and shattered into fragments by the wild winds of fate,
that should converge into storms on that fatal night to which so
many looked forward with pleasure.</p>

<p>And yet not the faintest presentiment of evil came to him that
day to whisper of the gathering clouds of destiny. He knew not
that his "house of cards" tottered on its foundation, that the
wreck and ruin of his dearest hope was about to be consummated.
He knew not, or he might have exclaimed with the
poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of all that life can teach us,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">There's naught so true as this;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The winds of fate blow ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But ever blow amiss!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The brief winter day came at length, gloomy and overcast,
with clouded sky that overflowed with a wild, tempestuous rain,
as though</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The heart of Heaven was breaking<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In tears o'er the fallen earth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At night the storm passed over, the bright stars shone through
the misty veil of darkness, a lovely silver moon hung its crescent
in the sky. All things seemed propitious for the hour that was
"big with fate" to the lovely girl whose changing fortunes we
have followed to the turning point of her life.</p>

<p>Cold, and dark, and gloomy though it seemed outside, all was
light, and warmth, and summer in the splendid chateau.</p>

<p>Hot-house flowers bloomed everywhere in the most lavish profusion.
The air was heavy with their fragrance.</p>

<p>Entrancing strains of music echoed through the splendid halls,
tempting light feet to the gay whirl of the dance. The splendid
drawing-rooms, opening into each other, looked like long vistas
of fairy-land, in the glow of light, and the beauty shed around by
countless flowers overflowing great marble vases everywhere.
The gay masquers moved through the entrancing scene, chatting,
laughing, dancing, as though life itself were but one long revel.
In the banqueting hall the long tables were loaded with every
luxury under the sun, temptingly spread on gold and silver
plates. Nothing that taste could devise, or wealth could procure,
was lacking for the enjoyment of the guests; and pleasure reigned
supreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>It was almost the hour for unmasking, and Colonel Carlyle
stood alone, half hidden by a crimson-satin curtain, looking on
idly at the gay dancers before him.</p>

<p>He felt weary and dull, though he would not have owned it for
the world. He hated to feel the weakness and feebleness of old
age creeping over him, as it was too surely doing, and affected
to enter into all the gaieties of the season, with the zest and ardor
of a younger and stronger man.</p>

<p>He had for a few moments felt dull, sad and discontented.
The reason was because he had lost sight of his beautiful idol
whom no mask could hide from his loving eyes.</p>

<p>She had disappeared in the moving throng a little while ago,
and now he impatiently waited until some happy chance should
restore her to his sight again.</p>

<p>"I am very foolish over my darling," he said to himself, half
proudly, half seriously. "I do not believe that any young man
could worship her as passionately as I do. I watch over her as
closely and jealously as if some dread mischance might remove
her from my sight at any moment. Ah, those dreadful two
years in which I so cruelly put her out of my life and starved my
eyes and my heart&mdash;would that I might recall them and undo
their work! Those years of separation and repentance have
sadly aged me!"</p>

<p>He sighed heavily, and again his anxious gaze roved through
the room.</p>

<p>"Ah, there she is," he murmured, delightedly. "My beautiful
Bonnibel! how I wish the time for unmasking would come.
I cannot bear for her sweet face to be hidden from my sight."</p>

<p>At that moment a small hand fluttered down upon his arm.</p>

<p>He turned abruptly.</p>

<p>Beside him stood a woman whose dark eyes shone through her
concealing mask like coals of fire. She spoke in a low, unfamiliar
voice:</p>

<p>"I know you, sir. Your mask cannot hide Colonel Carlyle
from my eyes."</p>

<p>"Madam, you have the advantage of me," he answered politely.
"Will you accord me the privilege of your name?"</p>

<p>"It matters not," she answered, with a low, eerie laugh, whose
strangeness sent a cold thrill like an icy chill along his veins,
"I am but a wandering sibyl; I claim no name, no country."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will foretell my future," he said, humoring her
assumption of the character.</p>

<p>"It were best concealed," she said, and again he heard that
strange, blood-curdling laugh.</p>

<p>He bowed and stood gazing at her silently, wondering a little
who she could be.</p>

<p>The wandering sibyl stood silent, too, as if lost in thought.
Presently she started and spoke like one waking from a dream:</p>

<p>"And yet perhaps I may give you a word of warning."</p>

<p>"Pray do so," he answered carelessly, for his eyes had returned
to the graceful form of Bonnibel as she stood leaning against
a tall stand of flowers at a little distance from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman's eyes followed his. She frowned darkly beneath
her mask.</p>

<p>"You have gathered many distinguished guests around you
to-night, Colonel Carlyle," she said, abruptly.</p>

<p>"None more honored than yourself, madam, be sure, although
unknown," he answered, with a courtly bow.</p>

<p>"Pretty words," she answered, with a mocking laugh. "Let
me repay them by a friendly warning."</p>

<p>She bent nearer and breathed in a low, sibilant whisper:</p>

<p>"Your wife and the great artist who is your honored guest to-night,
were lovers long ago. Watch well how they meet when
unmasked to-night!"</p>

<p>With the words she glided from him like the serpent forsaking
Eden.</p>

<p>And that deadly serpent, jealousy, that had lain dormant in
the colonel's heart for months, "scotched but not killed," now
coiled itself anew for a fatal spring.</p>

<p>The blood in his veins seemed turning to liquid fire.</p>

<p>His heart beat so wildly that he could distinctly hear its rapid
throbs.</p>

<p>He felt frightened at the swiftness and violence of the passion
that flooded his whole being.</p>

<p>The words spoken by the masked woman seemed to burn themselves
into his heart.</p>

<p>"Your wife and the great artist who is your honored guest to-night
were lovers long ago. Watch well how they meet when
unmasked to-night."</p>

<p>For a moment Reason tried to assert her supremacy, and whisper,
"Peace, be still," to the seething whirlpool of emotion.</p>

<p>"Do not believe it," she said. "Someone is trying to tease
you. It is quite impossible that Bonnibel and this foreign artist
should have met before. Anonymous warnings should always
be treated with contempt."</p>

<p>And then he remembered the anonymous note he had received
at Long Branch two years before.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> was true," he said to himself. "Bonnibel as good as
admitted it, for she would not show me the inscription in the
ring, and she refused to give up wearing it. But she said that
the giver was dead. Had she had two lovers, then, innocent and
youthful as she was? Perhaps she deceived me. Women are not
to be trusted, they say. I will obey the warning of my unknown
friend and watch."</p>

<p>He waited impatiently for the summons to supper, which
would be the signal for laying aside the masks.</p>

<p>"It must be true," he said to himself, "for that would explain
why he was so discourteous about painting her portrait.
He did not wish to be thrown into familiar contact with her
again. Perhaps she had used him cruelly. It may be that she
threw him over because he was poor and unknown, then, and
accepted me only for the sake of my wealth."</p>

<p>He was nearly maddened by these tumultuous thoughts. He
was almost on the point of going to her at once and overwhelming
her with the accusation of her wrong-doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment the signal came and his guests unmasked.</p>

<p>He saw Monsieur Favart coming toward him accompanied by a
handsome distinguished-looking young man in the costume of a
knight. He had never met the great Roman artist, yet he felt a
quick intuition that this must be the man. The premonition was
verified for Monsieur Favart paused before him and said:</p>

<p>"Colonel Carlyle, it gives me pleasure to present my artist
friend, Mr. Dane."</p>

<p>The two gentlemen bowed to each other, but for a moment
Colonel Carlyle could not speak. When he did his voice was
hoarse and strained, and his words of welcome were so few that
Monsieur Favart looked at him in surprise. What had become of
the old colonel's urbanity and courtliness?</p>

<p>"You will allow me to present you to my wife, Mr. Dane,"
said the host, breaking the silence with an effort.</p>

<p>The artist bowed and they moved down the long room side by
side, the old man with his white face and silvery beard, the young
one with his princely grace and refined beauty.</p>

<p>Leslie Dane had been most reluctant to attend the ball given by
the American colonel, but Carl Muller had teased him into compliance.
He had nerved himself for the trial, and found that he
could bear the contact with one from his native land with more
<i>sang froid</i> than he expected.</p>

<p>"Now I shall see the old lady," was his half-smiling comment
to himself as he walked along. "I wonder if she is very angry
with me because I would not paint her portrait."</p>

<p>The next moment, before he had time to raise his eyes, he found
himself bowing hurriedly at the sound of his host's voice uttering
the usual formal words of introduction.</p>

<p>Bonnibel was standing alone by a tall <i>jardiniere</i> of flowers,
looking downward a little thoughtfully. She was dressed as
Undine, in a floating robe of sea-green, with billows of snowy
tulle, looped with water-lilies and sea-grasses, and lightly embroidered
with pearls and tiny sea-shells. Her appropriate ornaments
were <i>aquamarines</i> in a setting of golden shells. Her long,
golden hair fell unbound over her shoulders and rippled to her
waist, enveloping her form in a halo of brightness. She looked
like a beautiful siren of old ocean, as fair and fresh and beautiful
as Venus when she first arose from its coral caves.</p>

<p>Someone had said to her just a moment before, "Mrs. Carlyle,
you look like a beautiful picture," and the words had recalled to
her mind the great artist who had refused to paint her portrait.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Mr. <i>Deane</i> is here to-night," she was thinking,
when Colonel Carlyle's voice spoke suddenly beside her, and she
bowed haughtily, actuated by a little feeling of pique, and lifted
her sea-blue eyes to the face of the artist. She met his gaze
fixed steadily upon her with a look of utter surprise, bitter pain
and bitterer scorn upon his deathly pale face. In an instant the
tide of time rolled backward and these two, standing face to
face the first time in years, knew each other!</p>

<p>Ah, me! how could she bear the revelation that flashed over
her so swiftly, and live through its horror, its shame and disgrace!
The words she had been about to speak died unuttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
on her lips, the lights, the flowers, the stern, set face of Leslie
Dane, all swam before her eyes as things "seen in a glass,
darkly." She threw up her hands blindly and reeled backward,
striking against the light <i>jardiniere</i> as she fell. It was overturned
by the shock, and scattered its wealth of flowers about
her as she lay there unconscious, as beautiful, as fragile, as innocent
as they.</p>

<p>For a moment neither Colonel Carlyle nor Leslie Dane moved
or spoke. It was a third person who pushed past them and lifted
the fair, inanimate form. For Colonel Carlyle, there was murder
seething in his jealous heart that moment, and in the breast
of Leslie Dane a grand scorn was strangling every emotion of
pity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Falser than all fancy fathoms,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Falser than all songs have sung,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was the thought in his heart as he looked down on the pale and
lifeless face.</p>

<p>People crowded around, with advice and restoratives, and as
she came back slowly to life they asked her what had caused her
to faint. Was she ill, were the flowers too overpowering, were
the rooms too warm?</p>

<p>"I struck my head against the <i>jardiniere</i> and fell," was all she
would say as she hid her pale face in her hands to shut out the
sight of the cold, calm eyes that looked down upon her with
veiled scorn.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle revived sufficiently to lead her away to her
room, and people told each other that an accident had happened
to Mrs. Carlyle. She had struck her head against the <i>jardiniere</i>
of flowers and fainted from the pain.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>Colonel Carlyle would fain have lingered in Bonnibel's
apartment and asked for some explanation of her fainting spell,
which he was convinced was the result of her meeting with the
artist, although her simple assertion of striking her head against
the <i>jardiniere</i> had deceived all others except himself, as it might
have deceived him but for the warning of the masked sibyl.</p>

<p>But it was quite true that she had hurt her head, and when
the faithful Lucy parted the thick locks and began to dress the
slight wound, her young mistress turned so ghastly pale and
closed her eyes so wearily that the jealous old man saw that it
was no fitting time for recrimination, and went away to attend to
his guests, half-resolved to have it out with the artist himself.</p>

<p>But calmer thoughts stepped in and forbade this indulgence of
his spleen. After all, what could he say to the young man? What
did he know wherewith to accuse him? His anonymous informant
had only said that his wife and the artist had been former
lovers. What, then? How the gay world would have
laughed if he picked a quarrel with the lion of the hour on such
a charge as that.</p>

<p>Many of the women whom Colonel Carlyle knew would have
deemed it an honor to have been loved either in the past or present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
by the gifted artist. No, there was nothing he could say to
the man on the subject, yet he determined that he would at
least watch him closely, and if&mdash;if there should be even the faintest
attempt on his part to revive the intimacy of the past, then woe
unto him, for Colonel Carlyle was nerved to almost any act of
frenzy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bonnibel lifted her head when the colonel was gone and looked
at her faithful attendant with a face on which death itself seemed
to have set its seal.</p>

<p>"Oh, me! Miss Bonnibel, you are as white as a ghost," exclaimed
Lucy. "And no wonder! It is a bad cut, though not very
deep. Does it hurt you very much?"</p>

<p>"What are you talking of, Lucy? What <i>should</i> hurt me?" inquired
her mistress in a wild, startled tone, showing that she had
quite forgotten her wound.</p>

<p>"Why, the cut on your head, to be sure," said Lucy in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh! Heaven, I had forgotten that," moaned the poor young
creature. "I do not feel the pain, Lucy, for the wound in my
heart is much deeper. It is of that only I am thinking."</p>

<p>She bowed her face in her hands and deep, smothered moans
shook her from head to foot. The delicate frame reeled and shook
with emotion like some slender reed shaken by a storm.</p>

<p>Lucy knelt down at her feet and implored her mistress to tell
her what she could do to help her in her trouble, whatever it
might be.</p>

<p>"Miss Bonnibel," she urged, "tell me something that I can do
for you&mdash;anything, no matter what, to help you out of your
trouble if I can."</p>

<p>Bonnibel hushed her sobs by a great effort of will, and looked
down at the faithful creature.</p>

<p>"Bring me my writing-desk, Lucy," she said, "and I will tell
you what you can do for me."</p>

<p>Lucy complied in wondering silence.</p>

<p>Bonnibel took out a creamy white sheet, smooth as satin, and
wrote a few lines upon it with a shaking hand. Then she dashed
her pen several times through the elaborate monogram "B.C."
at the top of the sheet.</p>

<p>"Lucy," she said, as she inclosed her note in an envelope and
hastily addressed it, "do you remember a gentleman who used
to visit at Sea View before my Uncle Francis died&mdash;a Mr. Dane?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly well, ma'am," Lucy responded, promptly. "He
was an artist."</p>

<p>"Yes, he was an artist. Should you know him again, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"I think I should, ma'am. He was very handsome, with dark
eyes and hair," said the girl, who was by no means behind her
sex in her appreciation of manly beauty.</p>

<p>"He is down-stairs now, Lucy&mdash;he is one of our guests to-night,"
said Bonnibel, with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>"Is it possible, ma'am?" exclaimed the girl, in surprise. "I
thought&mdash;at least I heard&mdash;Miss Herbert's maid told me a long
while ago that Mr. Dane was dead."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was some mistake," answered Bonnibel, drearily. "He
is alive&mdash;I have seen him. And now, Lucy, I will tell you what
I wish you to do."</p>

<p>The girl stood listening attentively.</p>

<p>"You will take this note, my good girl, and go down-stairs
and put it in the hands of Mr. Dane, if you can find him. Try
and deliver it to him unobserved, and bring me back his answer."</p>

<p>"I will find him if he is to be found anywhere," said Lucy,
taking the note and departing on her secret mission.</p>

<p>Leslie Dane's first passionate impulse after his abrupt meeting
with his lost wife was to leave the house which sheltered her
false head.</p>

<p>But as he was about to put his resolve into execution he was
accosted by a group of ladies and detained for half an hour listening
to an idle hum of words, from which he longed to tear
himself away in the frenzy of scorn and indignation which possessed
him.</p>

<p>At length he excused himself, and was about passing through
the deserted hall on his way out when he encountered Bonnibel's
maid.</p>

<p>Lucy had, like many illiterate persons, a keen recollection of
faces. She knew the artist immediately.</p>

<p>"You are Mr. Dane," she said, going up to him after a keen
glance around to see if she were unobserved.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, looking at her in wonder.</p>

<p>"I have a note for you, sir. Please read it and give me an
answer at once."</p>

<p>He took it, tore off the envelope, and read the few lines that
Bonnibel had penned, while a frown gathered on his brow.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment."</p>

<p>He took a gold pencil from his pocket and hastily scribbled a
few lines on the back of Bonnibel's sheet. Lucy, watching him
curiously under the glare of gas-light, saw that he was deadly
pale, and trembled like a leaf.</p>

<p>"Give this to your mistress," he said, putting the sheet back
in the torn envelope, "and tell her that I am gone."</p>

<p>He turned away and walked rapidly out of sight.</p>

<p>Lucy sighed, she could not have told why, and turned back
along the hall.</p>

<p>"Hold, girl!" exclaimed a hoarse, passionate voice behind her.</p>

<p>She turned in a fright, and saw Colonel Carlyle just behind
her, his features distorted by rage and passion. He caught her
arm violently and tore the note from her grasp.</p>

<p>"I will myself deliver this note to your mistress," he said, "and
as for you, girl, go!"</p>

<p>He dragged her along the hallway to the open door, and pushed
her out violently into the street, bareheaded and with no wrapping
to protect her frail, womanly form from the rigors of the
wintry night.</p>

<p>"Go, creature!" he thundered after her, "go, false minion of a
false woman, and never darken these doors again with your hated
presence!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Lucy sank down upon the wet and sleety pavement with a
moan of pain, and Colonel Carlyle closed and locked the door upon
her defenseless form.</p>

<p>Rage had transformed the courteous old man into something
more fiend-like than human.</p>

<p>As soon as he had disposed of his wife's attendant so summarily
he turned his attention to the note he had wrested from her
reluctant grasp.</p>

<p>Retiring into a deserted ante-room he opened and read it as
coolly as if it had been addressed to himself.</p>

<p>What he read caused the veins to start out upon his forehead
like great twisted cords, and his lips to writhe, while his face
grew purple, and his eyes almost started from their sockets.</p>

<p>Bonnibel had written:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Leslie, forgive me if you can. Before God, I wronged you
innocently! I thought you <i>dead</i>! If there is one spark of pity
or honor in your breast <i>keep my secret</i>. It would <i>kill</i> me to have
it known to the <i>world</i>! I will go away from here and hide myself
in obscurity forever! Of course I cannot remain with Colonel
Carlyle a day longer. You seemed very angry to-night&mdash;your
eyes flashed lurid lightnings upon me. I pray you, do not believe
me willfully guilty&mdash;do not betray me for the sake of revenge!
The shame, the horror, the disgrace of <i>our fatal secret</i>
will kill me soon enough.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Bonnibel.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Looking at the top of the page he saw that she had dashed her
pen several times through her monogram. He gnashed his teeth
at the sight.</p>

<p>"What could she possibly mean by it?" he asked himself, as he
turned the sheet and read the artist's reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Do not fear for your proud position, Bonnibel. Mine is the
last hand upon earth that would drag you down from it! Pursue
your wonted way in peace and serenity. You need not go
away&mdash;that is for me to do. God knows I would never have
come here to-night had I dreamed of meeting <i>you</i>! But try to
forget it! To-morrow I shall have passed out of your life forever,
and that most deplorable <i>secret</i> will be as safe with me as if I really
were dead!</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Leslie Dane.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Colonel Carlyle crumpled those strange, unfathomable notes
into his breast-pocket, and went out with ominous calm to bid
adieu to his parting guests.</p>

<p>They had enjoyed themselves so much, they said, and with
many regrets for Mrs. Carlyle's unfortunate accident they hastened
their departure.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Bonnibel sat crouching in her chair, a prey to the most hopeless
misery, waiting for Lucy's return.</p>

<p>She was stunned and bewildered by the force and suddenness
of the blow that had stricken her.</p>

<p>One tangible thought alone ran through the mass of confused
and conflicting feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>It was that she must fly, at all hazards, from her humiliating
position in Colonel Carlyle's house.</p>

<p>She did not know where she would go, or how she would
manage her flight. She would leave it all to Lucy.</p>

<p>The girl was clear-headed and intelligent. They would go away
together, and Lucy would find a hiding-place somewhere for her
wretched head.</p>

<p>But, oh! the shame, the misery of it all!</p>

<p>Leslie Dane was alive, yet she who was his wife in the sight of
Heaven dare not rejoice in the knowledge. His resurrection
from his supposed death had fixed a blighting hand upon her
beautiful brow.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" she moaned, wringing her white hands helplessly,
"what have I done to deserve this heavy cross?"</p>

<p>The minutes passed slowly, but Lucy did not return. The little
French <i>pendule</i> on the mantel chimed the quarters of the
hour three times while Bonnibel sat drooping in her chair alone.
Then the door was pushed rudely open and Colonel Carlyle entered.</p>

<p>In her dumb agony the creature failed to look up or even to
distinguish the difference in the step of Colonel Carlyle.</p>

<p>"You saw him, Lucy?" she asked, without lifting her head.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>She looked up in surprise at the girl's silence and saw Colonel
Carlyle standing in the center of the room regarding her fixedly.</p>

<p>Bonnibel had seen him jealous and enraged before, but she had
never seen him look as he did then.</p>

<p>The veins stood on his forehead like thick, knotted cords. His
face was purple with excitement, his eyes glared like those of a
wild animal, his hands were clenched. It seemed as though he
only restrained himself by a powerful effort of will from springing
upon and rending her to pieces.</p>

<p>Thus convulsed and speechless he stood gazing down upon
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Colonel Carlyle, you are ill," she exclaimed, regarding
him in terror. "Shall I not ring for assistance?"</p>

<p>He did not answer, but continued to gaze upon her in the same
stony silence.</p>

<p>Fearing that he was suddenly seized with some kind of a fit,
she sprang up and shook him violently by the arm.</p>

<p>But he shook off her grasp with such force and passion that
she lost her balance and fell heavily to the floor.</p>

<p>Half stunned by the violence of the fall she lay quite still a
moment, with closed eyes and gasping breath.</p>

<p>He looked at her as she lay there like a broken flower, but
made no effort to assist her.</p>

<p>Presently the dark blue eyes flashed open and looked up at him
with a quiet scorn in their lovely depths. She made no effort to
rise, and when she spoke her voice startled him with its tragic
ring.</p>

<p>"Finish your work, Colonel Carlyle," she said, in those deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
tones. "I will thank you and bless you if you will strike one
fatal blow that shall lay me dead at your feet."</p>

<p>Something in the words or the tone struck an arrow of remorse
into his soul. He bent down and lifted the slight form, gently
placing her back in her chair.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," he said, coldly, "I did not mean to hurt you,
but you should not have touched me. I could not bear the touch
of your hand."</p>

<p>She lifted her fair face and looked at him in wonder.</p>

<p>"Colonel Carlyle, what have I done to <i>you</i>?" she asked, in a
voice of strange pathos.</p>

<p>"You have wronged me," he answered, bitterly.</p>

<p>Her face blanched to a hue even more deathly than before, at
his meaning words. What did he suspect? What did he know?</p>

<p>"I know all," he continued, sternly.</p>

<p>For a moment she dropped her face in her hands and turned
crimson from brow to throat under his merciless gaze, then she
looked up at him proudly, and said, almost defiantly:</p>

<p>"If, indeed, you know all, Colonel Carlyle, you know, of a
truth, that I did not wrong you willfully."</p>

<p>He was silent a moment, drawing her crumpled note from his
breast and smoothing out the folds.</p>

<p>"This is all I know," he said, holding it up before her eyes.
"This tells me that you have wronged me, that you have a dreadful
secret&mdash;you and the man at whose feet you fainted to-night.
You must tell me that secret now."</p>

<p>"Where did you get the note?" she panted, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the artist gave it to me!" he sneered.</p>

<p>"I will not believe it," she said, passionately. "Lucy&mdash;where
is Lucy?"</p>

<p>"She is out in the street where I thrust her when I found her
with this note," he answered, harshly. "It is enough that
my roof must shelter a false wife, it shall not protect her false
minion!"</p>

<p>"Out in the street!" gasped Bonnibel, hoarsely. "In the cold
and the darkness. My poor Lucy! Let me go, too, then; I will
find her and go away with her. We will neither of us trouble
you!"</p>

<p>She was rushing to the door, but he pushed her back into her
seat, locked the door and put the key into his pocket.</p>

<p>"We will see if you shall disgrace me thus," he cried out.
"You would fly from me, you said. And where? Perhaps to
the arms of your artist-lover! You would heap this disgrace on
the head of an old man, whose only fault has been that he loved
you too well and trusted you too blindly."</p>

<p>She shivered as he denounced her so cruelly; but not one word
of defiance came from her pale, writhing lips. The fair face
was hidden in her hands, the golden hair fell about her like a veil.</p>

<p>"But I will protect my honor," he continued, harshly. "I
will see that you do not desert me and make my name a by-word
for the scorn of the world. You shall stay with me, even though
I am tempted to hate you; you shall stay with me if I have to
keep you <i>imprisoned</i> to save my honor!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked up at him wildly.</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake, let me go!" she said. "In pity for me, in
pity for yourself, let me go away from you forever! It is wrong
for me to stay&mdash;I ought to go, I must go! Let the world say
what it will&mdash;tell them I am dead, or tell them I am mad, and
chained in the walls of a mad-house! Tell them anything that
will save your honorable name from shame, but let me go from
under this roof, where I cannot breathe&mdash;where the air stifles me!"</p>

<p>"It must indeed be a fatal secret that can make you rave so
wildly," he answered, bitterly. "Let me hear it, Bonnibel, and
judge for myself if it is sufficient to exile my wife from my home
and heart."</p>

<p>She shivered at the words.</p>

<p>"Oh! indeed it is sufficient," she moaned, wringing her hands
in anguish. "I implore you to let me go."</p>

<p>"Let me be the judge," he answered again. "Tell me your
reasons for this wild step."</p>

<p>She was silent from sheer despair.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel, will you tell me the secret?" he urged, feverishly.</p>

<p>"I cannot. I cannot! Do not ask me!" she answered pleadingly.</p>

<p>"What if I demand it from Mr. Dane?" he said, threateningly.</p>

<p>"I do not believe he will tell you," she answered bitterly. "If
he did you would regret that you learned it. Oh! believe me,
Colonel Carlyle, that 'ignorance is bliss' to you in this case.
Oh! be merciful and let me go!"</p>

<p>"Would you know what answer your artist lover sent to your
wild appeal?" he exclaimed abruptly.</p>

<p>She looked at him wildly. He straightened out the sheet and
read over the words that Leslie Dane had written, in a bitter,
mocking tone.</p>

<p>"Leslie Dane," he repeated. "Leslie Dane! Why, this is
the first time I have caught the villain's name aright! It seems
familiar. I have heard it somewhere long ago&mdash;let me think."</p>

<p>In a sudden excess of excitement he dropped the note and
paced furiously up and down the room. Bonnibel watched him
forlornly under her drooping lashes.</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly with a violent start, and looked at her
sternly.</p>

<p>"I have it now," he said triumphantly. "My God! it is worse
than I thought; but when I knew his real name it all rushed over
me! Yes, Bonnibel, I know the fatal secret now, that you, oh!
my God, share with that miserable wretch!"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, you cannot know it," she breathed!</p>

<p>"I do know it," he answered sternly. "I remember it all now.
Leslie Dane is that guilty man who rests at this moment under
the charge of murdering your uncle!"</p>

<p>"It is false!" she exclaimed, confronting him indignantly.
"No one ever breathed such a foul aspersion upon Leslie Dane
but you!"</p>

<p>"Great God! do you deny it?" he exclaimed in genuine surprise
and amazement. "Surely your brain is turned, Bonnibel.
Everyone knows that Leslie Dane was convicted of the murder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
on circumstantial evidence; everyone knows that he fled the
country and has been in hiding ever since. But the fatal charge
is still hanging over his head."</p>

<p>"I have never heard such a thing before, never! And I would
believe that Leslie Dane was guiltless in the face of all the evidence
in the world! He is the very soul of honor! He could not
do a cowardly act to save his life!" exclaimed Bonnibel, springing
up in a fever of passionate excitement.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle was fairly maddened by her words.</p>

<p>"You shall see whether he be guilty or not," he exclaimed,
leaving the room in a rage.</p>

<p>Bonnibel heard the key grate in the lock outside, and discovered,
to her dismay, that she was Colonel Carlyle's prisoner in
truth.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>


<p>"You went off from the ball in a hurry last night, Leslie.
Why did you not stop for me?"</p>

<p>It was Carl Muller who spoke. He had come into Mr. Dane's
rooms the morning after the ball and found him sitting over a
cup of coffee, looking haggard and weary in the clear light of day.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Carl," he responded. "The actual truth is, I forgot
you. I was tired and wanted to come away, and I did so,
<i>sans ceremonie</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, you look fagged and tired out, that's a fact. I never
saw you look so ill. Have a smoke; it will clear the mist from
your brain."</p>

<p>"Thank you, no," said the artist, briefly.</p>

<p>Carl sat down on a chair and hummed a few bars of a song
while he regarded his friend in some surprise at his altered looks.</p>

<p>"I was sorry you went off without me, last night," he said
presently. "I wanted to chaff you a little. Weren't you surprised
and abashed when you found that the old woman whose
portrait you declined to paint was the loveliest angel in the world?"</p>

<p>"It was quite a surprise," Mr. Dane said, sipping his <i>cafe au
lait</i> composedly.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such a beautiful young creature?" continued
Carl, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the unexpected reply.</p>

<p>"You have!" exclaimed Carl; "I did not think it possible for
two such divinities to exist upon this earth. Have the goodness
to tell me where you ever saw Mrs. Carlyle's equal in grace and
loveliness."</p>

<p>But Mr. Dane, who but seldom descended to Carl's special prerogative,
poetry, sat down his cup and slowly repeated like one
communing with himself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'I remember one that perished; sweetly did she speak and move;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such an one do I remember, whom to look at was to love.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"She is dead, then?" said Carl.</p>

<p>"She is dead to me," was the bitter reply.</p>

<p>And with a significant look Carl repeated the lines that came
next to those that Leslie had quoted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No, she never loved me truly; love is love forevermore.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Forevermore," Leslie Dane repeated with something like a
sigh.</p>

<p>He rose and began to pace the floor with bowed head and
arms folded over his breast.</p>

<p>"Carl," he said suddenly, "I have had enough of Paris.
Have you?"</p>

<p>"What, in seven days? Why, my dear fellow, I have just begun
to enjoy myself. I have only had a taste of pleasure yet."</p>

<p>"I am going back to Rome to-day," continued Leslie.</p>

<p>"I should like to know why you have made this sudden decision,
Leslie&mdash;for it is sudden, is it not?" asked Carl, pointedly.</p>

<p>Leslie Dane flushed scarlet, then paled again.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is sudden," he answered, constrainedly, "but none the
less decisive. Don't try to argue me out of it, Carl, for that
would be useless. Believe me, it is much better that I should go.
I want to get to work again."</p>

<p>"There is something more than work at the bottom of this
sudden move," said Carl Muller, quietly. "I don't wish to intrude
on your secrets, <i>mon ami</i>, but I could tell you just why
you are going back to Rome in such a confounded hurry."</p>

<p>"You could?" asked Leslie Dane, incredulously.</p>

<p>"You know I told you long ago, Leslie, that there is a woman at
the bottom of everything that happens. There is one at the bottom
of this decision of yours. You are running away from a
woman!"</p>

<p>"The deuce!" exclaimed Leslie, startled out of his self-control
by Carl Muller's point-blank shot; "how know you that?"</p>

<p>"I can put two and two together," the German answered,
coolly.</p>

<p>Leslie looked at him with a question in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Shall I explain?" inquired Carl.</p>

<p>Leslie bowed without speaking.</p>

<p>"Well, then, last night, when we laid aside our masks I happened
to be quite near to our lovely hostess, and a friend who
was beside me immediately presented me."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Leslie Dane, with white lips.</p>

<p>"I was immediately impressed with the idea," continued Carl,
"that I had met Mrs. Carlyle before. The impression grew upon
me steadily during the minute or two while I stood talking to
her, although I could not for the life of me tell where I had met
her. But after I had left her side I stood at a little distance and
observed her presentation to you."</p>

<p>Leslie Dane walked away to a window and stood looking out
with his back turned to his friend.</p>

<p>"I saw her look at you, Leslie," Carl went on, "and that minute
she fell back and fainted. They said that she struck her head
against the <i>jardiniere</i>, which caused her to faint. But I know
better. She may have struck her head&mdash;I do not dispute that&mdash;but
the primal cause of her swoon was the simple sight of <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>"I do not know why you should think so, Carl," said his
friend, without turning round. "It is not plausible that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
mere sight of a stranger should have thus overcome her. Am I
so hideous as that?"</p>

<p>"You were not a stranger," said Carl, overlooking the latter
query, "for in that moment when she bowed to you it flashed
over me like lightning who she was. I was mistaken when I
thought I had met her before. She was utterly a stranger to
me. But I had seen her peerless beauty portrayed in a score of
pictures from the hand of a master artist. It is no wonder the
resemblance haunted me so persistently."</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute. Leslie did not move or speak.</p>

<p>"Leslie, you cannot deny it," Carl said, convincingly: "the
beautiful Mrs. Carlyle is the original of the veiled portrait you
used to keep in your studio, and which you allowed me to look at
only on the occasion when you painted it out."</p>

<p>"I do not deny it," he said, in a voice of repressed pain.
"What then, Carl?"</p>

<p>"This, <i>mon ami</i>&mdash;she was false to you! I do not know in what
way, but possibly it was by selling herself for that old man's gold.
You owe her no consideration. Why should you curtail your
holiday and disappoint your friends and admirers merely because
her guilty conscience feels a pang at meeting you? You two can
keep apart. Paris is surely large enough for both to dwell in
without jostling each other."</p>

<p>What Leslie Dane might have answered to this reasoning will
never be a matter of history, for before he could open his lips to
speak there was a thundering rap at the door.</p>

<p>In some suspense he advanced and threw it open.</p>

<p>Three or four officers of the French police, in their neat uniform,
stood in the hallway without.</p>

<p>"Enter, gentlemen," he said, courteously, though there was a
tone of surprise in his voice that they could not mistake.</p>

<p>Carl Muller, too, though he did not speak, rose from his seat
and expressed his amazement by his manner.</p>

<p>The officers filed into the room gravely, closing the door after
them. Then the foremost one advanced, with an open paper in
his hand, and laid his hand firmly but respectfully on Leslie
Dane's arm.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Dane," he said, in clear, incisive tones that fell like
a thunder-clap on the hearing of the two artists&mdash;"Monsieur Dane,
I arrest you for the willful murder of Francis Arnold at his home
in America three years ago!"</p>

<p>"<i>Quelle horreur</i>, Felise! that was a shocking <i>denouement</i> to-night.
We tremble on the brink of a volcano."</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold and her daughter were rolling homeward in their
luxurious carriage from the masquerade ball at Colonel Carlyle's
chateau, and the elder lady's remark was uttered in a tone of
trepidation and terror.</p>

<p>But Felise leaning back in her corner among the silken cushions
in the picturesque costume of a fortune-teller, only laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
at her terror&mdash;a low and fiendish laugh that expressed unqualified
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"<i>Ma mere</i>, was Leslie Dane's resurrection a great surprise to
you?" she inquired, with a covert sneer.</p>

<p>"A great surprise, and a terrible shock to me, too," the lady
answered. "Of course, after believing him dead so long, it is
very inconvenient to have him come to life again&mdash;as inconvenient
for Colonel Carlyle and his wife as for us."</p>

<p>And again Felise laughed mockingly, as if she found only the
sweetest pleasure in her mother's words.</p>

<p>"Felise, I cannot understand you," exclaimed Mrs. Arnold,
anxiously. "Surely you forget the peril we are in from this
man's resurrection from the grave where we thought him lying.
I thought you would be as much surprised and frightened at this
dreadful <i>contretemps</i> as I am."</p>

<p>"I have known that Leslie Dane was living all these three
years," answered Miss Herbert, as coolly as before.</p>

<p>"Then the paper you showed to me and to Bonnibel must have
been a forgery!'</p>

<p>"It was. I had the notice of Leslie Dane's death inserted myself."</p>

<p>The carriage paused at their hotel, and they were handed out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold followed her daughter to her own apartments.</p>

<p>"Send your maid away, Felise. I must talk to you a little,"
she said.</p>

<p>Felise had a French maid now instead of Janet, who had resolutely
declined to cross the ocean with her.</p>

<p>"Finette, you may go for awhile," she said. "I will ring when
I need you."</p>

<p>The maid courtesied and went away.</p>

<p>Felise motioned her mother to a chair, and sank into another
herself. Mrs. Arnold seated herself and looked at her daughter
searchingly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold took up the conversation where it had been dropped
when they left the carriage.</p>

<p>"You say you forged the notice of Leslie Dane's death in the
newspaper," she said. "Of course you had some object in doing
that, Felise."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," with another wicked laugh. "It was to
further the revenge of which I have had so sweet a taste to-night."</p>

<p>"So what has happened to-night is only what you have intended
and desired all along?"</p>

<p>Felise bowed with the grace of a duchess.</p>

<p>"Exactly," she answered, with a triumphant smile. "I have
been planning and scheming over two years to bring about the
consummation of to-night."</p>

<p>"It was cleverly planned and well executed," Mrs. Arnold said,
admiringly; "but is it quite finished? Of course Colonel Carlyle
does not know the truth yet."</p>

<p>"He knows that Leslie Dane was a former lover of his wife; he
witnessed their meeting to-night. That of itself was enough to
inflame his jealous passions to the highest degree, and make him
wretched. I rely upon Bonnibel herself to finish my work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Upon Bonnibel! How will she do it?"</p>

<p>"You know her high and overstrained sense of honor, mother.
Of course she will not remain with Colonel Carlyle, now that she
knows she is not his wife. There is but one course open to her.
She will fly with Leslie Dane, and leave a note behind her revealing
the whole truth to him."</p>

<p>"Are you sure she will, Felise?"</p>

<p>"I am quite certain, mother. That is the only orthodox mode
for such a heroine of romance as your husband's niece. To-morrow
Leslie Dane and his silly young wife will have flown beyond
pursuit and discovery, yet neither one can be happy. The
years in which she has belonged to Colonel Carlyle will be a blight
and a blot upon her fair fame that she can never forget,
while Leslie Dane, with the passions of manhood burning in his
veins, <i>cannot</i> forget and will scarcely <i>forgive</i> it. They cannot be
happy. My revenge has struck too deep at the root of that evanescent
flower that the world calls happiness. And Colonel Carlyle
is the proudest man on earth. Think you that he can ever
hold up his head again after the shame and disgrace of that
dreadful blow?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely," said Mrs. Arnold, echoing her daughter's laugh
with one as cold and cruel. "You have taken a brave revenge,
Felise, for Colonel Carlyle's wrongs against you, and if all goes as
you have planned, I shall be proud of your talents and rejoice in
your success. But my mind misgives me. Suppose some
officious American here&mdash;and you know there are plenty such
now sojourning in Paris&mdash;should remember Leslie Dane and
arrest him for my husband's murder?"</p>

<p>For a moment Felise Herbert grew pale, and an icy hand seemed
tugging at her heart-strings.</p>

<p>"I do not have the least apprehension of such a calamity," she
answered, throwing off the chill presentiment with an effort. "I
feel sure that Leslie Dane and his Bonnibel will be far beyond
pursuit and detection before to-morrow night. And you will infinitely
oblige me by keeping your doleful croaking to yourself,
mother."</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold looked at her watch and rose wearily.</p>

<p>"It is almost morning," she said; "I think I will retire.
Good-night, my dear, and pleasant dreams."</p>

<p>"They cannot fail to be pleasant!" answered Felise, with her
mocking, triumphant laugh.</p>

<p>But her dreams were all waking ones.</p>

<p>She was too triumphant and excited to sleep.</p>

<p>"This is a happy, happy night for me!" she exclaimed again
and again.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>


<p>Bonnibel was completely crushed by the knowledge that
Colonel Carlyle had put into execution his threat of making her
a prisoner.</p>

<p>For a moment she ran wildly about the room, passionately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
seeking some mode of egress, filled with the impulse of seeking
and following her poor, maltreated Lucy.</p>

<p>But no loophole of escape presented itself.</p>

<p>Her suite of rooms, boudoir, dressing-room, and sleeping-apartment,
all communicated with each other, but only one
opened into the hall, or presented any mode of egress from her
imprisonment. Of this room, the boudoir which she then occupied,
Colonel Carlyle had taken the key. She was in an upper
story, many feet from the ground, or she would have jumped
from the window in her desperation. As it was she could do
nothing. She threw herself down upon the floor, crushing her
beautiful ball-dress with its grasses and lilies, and wept unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>The slight form heaved and shook with emotion, the tears rained
from her eyes in a torrent. At length, worn out with passionate
weeping, and overcome by the "dumb narcotic influence of pain,"
she fell asleep where she lay on the floor, her wet cheek pillowed
on her little hand, her golden hair floating about her in "sad
beauty."</p>

<p>Thus Colonel Carlyle found her when he entered, late that morning.
He was honestly shocked at the sight, for he had supposed
that she would yield gracefully to the inevitable, and retire to her
sleeping-apartment without more ado when she found how inflexible
a will he was possessed of. Instead, here she lay prostrate
on the rich velvet carpet of the boudoir, still attired in her ball-dress,
the traces of tears on her pale cheeks, and her restless
slumber broken by sobs and moans that shook her slight form
like a wind-shaken-willow.</p>

<p>He stood still looking down at her, while pity vainly struggled
against the fierce anger and resentment burning hotly in his
heart.</p>

<p>"She can grieve for him like this," he muttered bitterly, and
lifted her, not rudely, but yet unlovingly, and laid her down upon
a silken sofa.</p>

<p>The movement disturbed her, and for a moment she seemed
about to wake; but the heavy lethargy of her troubled sleep overpowered
her.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle stood silently watching her for a little while,
marveling at her beauty even while he felt angry with her for
the uncontrollable emotion that had touched her fairness with
the penciling of grief. Then, with a deep yet unconscious sigh,
he kissed her several times and went softly away. It was noon
when she started up from her restless slumbers, pushing off the
silken coverlet that had been carefully spread over her.</p>

<p>She sat up, pressing her hand upon her aching temples, and
looked about the room with dazed, half-open eyes. For the moment
she had forgotten her trouble of the previous night, and
fully expected to see her faithful Lucy Moore keeping her patient
vigil by the couch of her weary mistress. But memory returned
all too swiftly. The kind, loving face of Lucy did not beam its
welcome upon her as of old. Instead, the cold, hard face of a
smartly-dressed, elderly Frenchwoman looked curiously at her
as the owner rose and courtesied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am the new maid, madam," she explained. "I hope
madam feels better."</p>

<p>Bonnibel stared at her in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Where is Lucy? I want Lucy," she said almost appealingly.</p>

<p>"Madam, I knows nothing of Lucy," she answered. "<i>Monsieur
le colonel</i>, the husband of madam, engage me to attend upon
madam. I will remove your ball dress, <i>s'il vous plait</i>."</p>

<p>With those words the whole bitter truth rushed over Bonnibel's
mind. A low, repressed cry, and she fell back on the sofa,
again hiding her convulsed face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Madam, you make yourself more sick by dis emotion," said
the new maid in her broken English. "Allow me to bring you
someding to break your fast&mdash;some chocolate, a roll, a bit of
broiled bird."</p>

<p>"I want nothing," Bonnibel answered, bitterly at first, but the
next moment she sat up and struggled to regain her composure.</p>

<p>"What is your name, my good woman?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Dolores, madam, at your service," said the maid, with one of
her low courtesies, "Dolores Dupont."</p>

<p>Bonnibel rose and moved slowly toward her dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Dolores," she said, "you may come and remove this robe. I
was very tired last night, and my maid having left me, I fell
asleep in my ball costume."</p>

<p>Dolores deftly removed the crushed and ruined robe, and substituted
a dressing-gown, while she brushed and arranged the
beautiful golden hair that was straying on her shoulders in
wild disorder.</p>

<p>"It is the most beautiful hair in de world," she said. "Dere
are many ladies would give a fortune to have it on deir own
heads."</p>

<p>But Bonnibel did not heed the praise. She had no thought or
care for her beauty now. She only said, listlessly:</p>

<p>"Never mind removing the dressing-gown, Dolores, I will lie
down again. I am very tired."</p>

<p>"I shall bathe your head with the <i>eau de cologne</i>&mdash;shall I?" the
maid inquired.</p>

<p>"No, no, only let me rest."</p>

<p>"You will breakfast, at least, madam?" the woman persisted.</p>

<p>"Not now, Dolores. I wish for nothing but rest," she said, as
she passed into her boudoir and lay down again upon the sofa.</p>

<p>The maid followed after her.</p>

<p>"I should wish your keys, madam, to pack your trunks," she
said, solicitously.</p>

<p>"To pack my trunks!" exclaimed the mistress, in surprise.
"Why should you wish to do that, Dolores?"</p>

<p>Dolores looked back at her in surprise also.</p>

<p>"For your journey, of course, Madam Carlyle," she said.
"Monsieur, your husband, tells me dat Paris do not agree with
your health, and dat he removes you dis day to his palace in
Italy on de Bay of Naples."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p>Alas for that one triumphant night of Felise Herbert. It was
succeeded by a day of disappointment.</p>

<p>It was scarcely noon before she heard that Colonel Carlyle had
caused the arrest of Leslie Dane upon the charge of murdering
Mr. Arnold, and that he had been committed to prison to await
a requisition from the governor of New Jersey, in which State
the deed had been committed. Mrs. Arnold entering her room in
a tremor of nervous agitation, found her pacing the floor, wildly
gesticulating, and muttering to herself, in terms of the fiercest
denunciation, anathemas against Colonel Carlyle.</p>

<p>"The miserable old dotard!" she exclaimed, furiously. "To
think that his madness should have carried him to such lengths!
Just when I felt so sure of my revenge he has balked me of my
satisfaction and imperiled my safety by his jealous madness!"</p>

<p>"Felise, you have heard all, then?" exclaimed Mrs. Arnold,
anxiously.</p>

<p>Felise turned her blazing dark eyes toward her mother, and
Mrs. Arnold shuddered.</p>

<p>"All, all!" she echoed passionately; "ill news flies apace!"</p>

<p>"Felise, I feared this!" exclaimed Mrs. Arnold. "You were
over-confident last night. Who could tell what form that old
man's madness would take?"</p>

<p>"Who, indeed!" cried her daughter passionately. "And yet
my theory seemed so plausible&mdash;who could have dreamed of its
failure? But for him all would have gone as I planned it! But
you cannot dream, mother, what that besotted old villain had the
audacity to do!"</p>

<p>"It is not possible he suspected your complicity in the affair,
Felise&mdash;he has taken no steps against <i>us</i>?" wildly questioned the
mother as she sank into a chair half-fainting with terror.</p>

<p>"No, no, he has not done that, mother&mdash;his deviltry took another
form."</p>

<p>"What, then, my dear? Oh! Felise, do sit down and calm
yourself, and let us talk this matter over quietly," implored Mrs.
Arnold anxiously.</p>

<p>"Calm myself&mdash;ha, ha, ha, when the blood in my veins has
turned to molten fire, and is burning me to ashes! You are an
iceberg, mother, with your cold words and calm looks, but you
cannot put out the fire that is raging within me! Surely I must
be wholly my father's child! There is nothing of you about me&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is like her father&mdash;the more pity! For there was
madness in his blood," Mrs. Arnold muttered inaudibly; "and I,
oh! God&mdash;all my life I have fostered her evil passions, in my greed
of gold, until now, when her reason totters on the brink of insanity.
Oh! that I might undo my part in this fearful tragedy,
and save her from the gulf that yawns beneath her feet!"</p>

<p>Overcome by her late remorse and terrible forebodings, she hid
her face in her hands while a nervous trembling seized upon her
from head to foot. Felise paused in her frenzied walk and eyed
her curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother, are you turning coward in the face of danger?" she
asked, with a ring of contempt in her voice.</p>

<p>There was no reply. The bowed face still rested on the trembling
hands, the form still shook with nervous terror. Something
in the weakness and forlornness of that drooping attitude in the
mother who had subordinated everything else to her daughter's
welfare, struck like a chill upon Felise, and partially tamed the
devil raging within her. She spoke in a gentler tone:</p>

<p>"Rouse yourself, mother. See! I have quite sobered down,
and am ready to discuss the matter as calmly and dispassionately
as you could wish. Ask what you please, and I will answer."</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold looked up, taking new heart as she saw that Felise
still retained the power to subdue her fiery passions.</p>

<p>"Then tell me, dear, what else Colonel Carlyle has done besides
causing Leslie Dane's arrest," said her mother.</p>

<p>Felise grasped the arms of her chair and held herself within it
by a frenzied effort of will. Her voice was low and intense as
she answered:</p>

<p>"Mother&mdash;he found out that Bonnibel was about to fly from
him last night&mdash;just as I told you she would, you remember&mdash;and
he&mdash;he actually locked her into her rooms, turned Lucy
Moore, her maid, into the street&mdash;and is keeping his wife a prisoner
to prevent her escape."</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold was too astonished to speak for a minute or two.
At length she found voice to utter:</p>

<p>"How know you that, Felise?"</p>

<p>"I have a spy in the chateau, mother&mdash;nothing that transpires
there remains long unknown to me," returned the daughter,
calmly.</p>

<p>Again there was momentary silence and surprise. Mrs. Arnold's
weaker nature was sometimes confounded by a new discovery of
her daughter's powerful capabilities for evil.</p>

<p>"What must Bonnibel's feelings be under the circumstances?"
she exclaimed at last.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine," was the dry response.</p>

<p>"Will she confess the truth to him, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell; I hope she <i>will not</i>," said Felise with strong
emphasis.</p>

<p>"I thought you wished him to know the truth. Was not that
a part of your cherished scheme of revenge?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was, but 'there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the
lip,' you know. And now that he has prevented her escape with
Leslie Dane, and caused the artist's arrest, the only chance of
safety for you and me lies in his keeping her a close prisoner until
the trial is over."</p>

<p>"What can that avail us, Felise?"</p>

<p>"Can you not see?" exclaimed Felise impatiently. "Leslie
Dane must be sacrificed to save us. He must be convicted by
circumstantial evidence, and punished. Bonnibel is the only
person who could prove his innocence. Let her keep out of the
way and all will go well with us. Should she appear at the trial
then discovery and ruin stare us in the face."</p>

<p>"But you forget, my dear, that Leslie Dane can prove his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
<i>alibi</i> by the minister who married him that night, even though we
could procure Bonnibel's silence."</p>

<p>Felise laughed heartlessly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he could, certainly, but the question is, would he? I am
quite sure he would not."</p>

<p>"But why should he be silent when his life would most probably
pay the forfeit?" exclaimed Mrs. Arnold, with a slight
shudder.</p>

<p>"Mother, there are men who would die for an over-strained
point of honor. From all that I can gather from his intercepted
letters, Leslie Dane is precisely that sort of a man. He is a
Southerner, you know&mdash;a Floridian. You have been in the
South, and you know that its natives are proud, chivalrous, honorable
to the highest degree! Well, he can have no means of
knowing that Bonnibel is imprisoned by her husband&mdash;of course
the proud old colonel will keep that fact a dead secret, and invent
some plausible excuse for her retirement from society. The
artist can therefore attribute her absence from the trial to but one
thing."</p>

<p>"And that?" queried Mrs. Arnold.</p>

<p>"He will think that Bonnibel is silent because she would sooner
sacrifice him than lose her prestige in society, and her brilliant
position as the wife of Colonel Carlyle. He will scorn to betray
her secret, and will go to his death with the self-sacrifice of a
martyr."</p>

<p>"But suppose Colonel Carlyle should let Bonnibel go free?
What then?"</p>

<p>Felise laughed softly.</p>

<p>"He will not do so, mother. I have sent him an anonymous
letter to-day that will fairly madden him with jealousy. He
will never unlock her prison-door until the grass is growing over
the handsome face of Leslie Dane."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>


<p>Within the gloomy cell of a French prison Leslie Dane was
seated on a low cot-bed, looking out through the narrow, grated
window at the blue and sunny sky of France. The young artist
looked haggard and wan in the clear light of the pleasant day,
for though it was winter the rigors of that season had not yet
set in. His dark eyes had a look of suffering and despair in their
beautiful depths, and his lips were set in a weary line of pain. It
was the day after his incarceration, and he had spent a wretched,
sleepless night, almost maddened by the horror of his fearful
situation. Suddenly the heavy key turned in the iron door; it
swung open to admit a visitor, and then the jailer closed and re-locked
it, shutting into the gloomy cell the blonde face of Carl
Muller.</p>

<p>"<i>Bon jour</i>," he said, with his debonair smile that seemed to
light the gloomy place like a beam of sunshine. "How goes it,
<i>mon ami</i>?"</p>

<p>A gleam of pleasure shone faintly over his friend's haggard
features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it you, Carl?" he said; "I thought you had deserted me!"</p>

<p>"Ingrate, could you think it?" responded Carl. "I was busy
yesterday trying to find out some particulars of this mysterious
affair, and they would not admit me last night. I came this
morning as soon as they would let me in."</p>

<p>"Thanks Carl; I might have known you were true as steel.
And yet there is so much falsity and treachery on earth, how
could I be sure of your loyalty? Have you learned anything?"</p>

<p>"Your accuser is the American, Colonel Carlyle," was the
startling reply.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed Leslie Dane, with a violent start; and
then he added in a passionate tone, and half to himself: "Has
he not already wronged me beyond all forgiveness?"</p>

<p>"He seems to have pushed it forward with the greatest malignity,"
continued Carl. "There are other countrymen of yours
here in this city who declare they knew of the foul charge
against you, yet they say that the verdict against you was given
on purely circumstantial evidence, and that, such being the case,
they did not intend to molest you, believing that you might after
all be innocent of the crime. But Colonel Carlyle has pushed
the affair in a way that seems to indicate a personal spite against
you."</p>

<p>Leslie's broad, white brow clouded over gloomily.</p>

<p>"It is true, then, that there is such a charge against me. I
fancied there <i>must</i> be some mistake. The whole affair seemed
too monstrous for belief, yet you say it is a stern fact. It is so
inexplicable to me, for I swear to you, Carl, that up to the very
moment of my arrest yesterday I did not know that Francis
Arnold was dead."</p>

<p>"And I believe you, Leslie, as firmly as I believe in the purity
of my mother away off in my beloved Germany. I know you
never could have been guilty of such a foul crime."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks for your noble confidence, Carl. Now
I know that I have at least one true friend on earth. I was rather
cynical in such matters before. A sad experience had taught me
to distrust everyone," exclaimed Leslie, as he warmly grasped
the young German's hand. "But what reason do they assign for
my alleged commission of the crime?"</p>

<p>"They told me," said Carl, hesitatingly, "that you were poor
and unknown, and aspired to the hand of the millionaire's beautiful
and high-born niece. Mr. Arnold, they said, declined your
suit for the young lady's hand, and you became enraged and
left him, uttering very abusive language coupled with threats
of violence. He was murdered while sleeping in his arm-chair
that night on his piazza, and it was supposed that you had stealthily
returned and wreaked your vengeance upon him."</p>

<p>"My God!" said Leslie Dane, "they have made out a black
case against me, indeed. But upon whose circumstantial evidence
was my conviction based?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Arnold, the wife of the murdered man, and his step-daughter,
Miss Herbert, heard and witnessed the altercation
from their drawing-room windows. Their evidence convicted
you, it is said."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"My soul!" exclaimed the unhappy prisoner to himself. "Bonnibel
was there; she at least knew my innocence, yet she spoke
no word to clear me from that most foul aspersion! And yet I
could have sworn that she loved me as her own life. Oh, God!
She was falser than I could have dreamed. But, oh, that angel
face; those beguiling lips&mdash;how can they cover a heart so black?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, <i>mon ami</i>, don't give up like this," said Carl, distressed
by the sight of his friend's uncontrollable emotion. "It
is a monstrous thing, I know, and will involve no end of time
and worry before you get clear, of course, but, then, there is no
doubt of your getting off&mdash;you have only to prove your innocence,
and you can easily do that, you know. So let's take it as a joke,
and bear it bravely. Do you know I mean to cross the ocean with
you, and see the farce played out to the end? Then you shall
take me around, and do the honors of your native land."</p>

<p>Leslie looked at the bright, buoyant face of the German artist
as he spoke so cheerily, and a suspicious moisture crept into his
dark eyes. He dashed his hand across them, deeming it unmanly
weakness.</p>

<p>"Oh! Carl," he exclaimed, remorsefully, "how little I have
valued your friendship, yet how firm and noble it has proved itself
in this dark and trying hour! Forgive me, my friend, and
believe me when I say that I give you the sole affection and trust
of a heart that heretofore has trusted nothing of human kind, so
basely had it been deceived. I thank, I bless you for that promise
to stand by me in my trial! And now I will do what I
should have done long ago if I had known the value of your
noble heart. I will tell you my story, and you shall be my judge."</p>

<p>Word for word, though it gave him inexpressible pain to recall
it, he went over the story of his love for Bonnibel Vere, and her
uncle's rejection of his suit, and the high words that passed between
them. He passed lightly over their farewell, omitting but
one thing. It was the story of their moonlight sail and secret
marriage. That story was sealed within his breast. He would
have died before he would have revealed Bonnibel's fatal secret
to any living soul.</p>

<p>"I left Cape May, where they were summering, on the midnight
train," he concluded, "and the next day I sailed from New
York for Europe. I never heard from Francis Arnold or his
niece again. She had promised to be faithful to our love, but
though I wrote to her many times I never received one line in return
until that fatal note which you remember. In it she wrote
me that she loved another."</p>

<p>"Perfidious creature!" muttered Carl.</p>

<p>"I never heard of her again," continued Leslie, "until, to my
unutterable surprise, I met her as the wife of Colonel Carlyle."</p>

<p>"And it is for one so false and cruel that you rest under this
dreadful charge," exclaimed the German. "But, please God, you
will soon be cleared from it. Of course you will have no difficulty
in proving an <i>alibi</i>. That is all you need to clear you."</p>

<p>But Leslie did not answer, and his friend saw that he was pale
as death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course you can prove an <i>alibi</i>&mdash;cannot you, Leslie?" he
asked, with a shade of anxiety in his tone.</p>

<p>But Leslie looked at him with a gleam of horror in his dark
eyes, and his voice shook with emotion as he answered:</p>

<p>"No, Carl, I cannot!"</p>

<p>Carl Muller started as though a bullet had struck him.</p>

<p>"Leslie you jest," he exclaimed, hoarsely. "Of course you
can prove where you were at that exact time when the murder
took place. Your safety all hinges upon that. Do you not remember
where you were at that time?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Heaven, do I not remember? Every moment of that
time is indelibly stamped upon my memory," groaned the unhappy
prisoner.</p>

<p>"Then why do you talk so wildly, my dear fellow? All you
have to do is to tell where you were at that time, and produce
even one competent witness to prove it."</p>

<p>"I cannot do it!" Leslie answered, gravely.</p>

<p>"But, good Heavens, man, your life may have to pay the forfeit
if you fail to establish an <i>alibi</i> at the trial."</p>

<p>"I must pay the forfeit, then. Carl, I choose death rather
than the only available alternative," was the inscrutable and final
reply.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>"Words fail me, Colonel Carlyle, when I try to express my
burning sense of your injustice in this high-handed outrage!
What, in this enlightened age, in this nineteenth century, do
men turn palaces into prisons, and debar weak women of their
liberties? Am I a slave that you have turned your keys upon me,
and set hirelings and slaves to watch me? Am I a criminal? If
so, where is my crime?"</p>

<p>A long and elegant saloon in a beautiful palace in Italy. The
rich curtains of silk and lace are looped back from the windows,
and the view outside is the beautiful Bay of Naples with the clear,
blue, sunny sky reflected in its blue and sparkling waves. A
garden lies below the windows, rich, in this tropical clime, with
beautiful flowers, and vines and shrubbery, while groves of
oranges, lemons, figs and dates abound in lavish luxuriance.
Within the room that was furnished with princely magnificence
and taste, were a man and a woman, the man old, and bowed,
and broken, the woman young and more beautiful than it often
falls to the lot of women to be. Her delicate features, chiseled
with the rare perfection of a head carved in cameo, were flushed
with passion, and the glow of anger shone through the pure,
transparent skin, tinting it with an unusual bloom. As she
walked restlessly up and down the room, in her trailing robe of
soft azure hue, her sea-blue eyes blazed under their drooping
lashes until they looked black with excitement.</p>

<p>"I tell you," she said, pausing a moment, as no answer came to
her passionate outburst, and facing the man before her with a
slim, uplifted finger, as if in menace, "I tell you, Colonel Carlyle,
that the vengeance of Heaven will fall upon you for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
cruel, unmanly deed! Oh, how can you forget your sense of
honor as a soldier and a gentleman, and descend to an act so ignoble
and unworthy? To imprison a weak and helpless woman,
who has no friend or defender save Heaven! Oh, for shame, for
shame!"</p>

<p>His eyes fell before the unbearable scorn in hers, and he turned
as if to leave the room. But half way to the door he paused and
came back to her.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he said, sternly, "cease this wild raving, and
calm yourself. My troubles are hard enough to bear without the
additional weight of unmerited reproaches from you. I am of
all men the most miserable."</p>

<p>She shook off the hand with which he attempted to lead her to
a seat, as if there had been contagion in the mere contact of his
white, aristocratic fingers.</p>

<p>"No, do not touch me!" she exclaimed, wildly. "At least
spare me that indignity. All other relations that have existed
between us are altered now, and merged simply into this&mdash;I am
your prisoner, and you are my jailer. The eagle spurns the hand
of its captor. Remember, there is proud, untamable blood in
my veins that will not be subdued. I am Harry Vere's daughter."</p>

<p>Bonnibel saw him wince as the name of her beloved father
passed her lips.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are not lost to all sense of shame," she cried. "You
can tremble at the name of the hero you have wronged through
his helpless daughter! Oh, Colonel Carlyle, by the memory of
my father, whom you pretended to love and honor, I beg you to
let me go free from this place."</p>

<p>Her angry recklessness had broken down suddenly into pathetic
pleading. Her slender hands were locked together, her eyes
were lifted to his with great, raining tears shining in them. He
turned half away, trembling in spite of his iron will at sight of
those tearful eyes, and parted, quivering lips.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he answered, in a voice of repressed emotion, "my
suffering at the course I have found myself compelled to pursue
with you is greater than your own. I love you with all the
strength of a man's heart, and yet I am almost compelled to believe
you the falsest of women. And yet, through all the distrust
and suspicion which your recent conduct has forced me to harbor,
the instinct that bids me have faith in the honor of Harry Vere's
daughter is so much beyond the mere power of my reason that
at one little promise from your lips you might this moment go
free!"</p>

<p>"And that promise?" she asked, dashing the blinding tears
away from her eyes and looking into his face.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel, on the night when I presumed to lock you into
your chamber you were about to fly from me&mdash;to what fate I
know not, but&mdash;I feared the worst. Think of the shame, the
disgrace, the agony I must have endured from your desertion!
Can you wonder that I took stringent measures to prevent you
from carrying your wild project into execution? I would have
laid you <i>dead</i> at my feet before you should have broken my heart
and made me a target for the scorn of the world."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not flinch as he uttered the emphatic words and looked
keenly into her face. She thought of herself vaguely as of one
lying dead at the feet of that stern, old, white-haired man, yet
the passing thought came to her indifferently as to one who was
bearing the burden of a "life more pathetic than death." She
felt no anger rising within her at the threat. Only a faint, stifled
yearning awoke within her for a moment as his stern voice evoked
a vision of the rest and peace of the grave.</p>

<p>"You see how strongly I feel on this subject, my wife," he
continued, after a long pause, "yet even now you shall go free
if you will give me your sacred word of honor, by the memory
of your father, that you will not desert me&mdash;that you will not
leave me!"</p>

<p>Silence fell&mdash;a long, painful silence. He stood quite still, looking
down at her pale face, and waiting for her answer with quickened
heart-beats. For her, she seemed transformed to a statue
of marble only for the quick throbs that stirred the filmy lace
folded over her breast. She stood quite still, her eyes drooping
from his, a look of pitiful despair frozen on the deathly pallor of
her face. Outside they could hear a soft wind sighing among
the flowers and kissing the blue waves of the bay. Within, the
fragrance of an orange tree, blooming in a niche, came to them
with almost sickening oppressiveness. Still she made no sign of
answer.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he said, and his hoarse, strained voice fell so unnaturally
on the stillness that he started at its strange sound,
"Bonnibel, my darling little wife, you will give me that promise?"</p>

<p>She shivered through all her frame as if those pleading words
had broken her trance of silence.</p>

<p>"Do not ask me," she said, faintly, "I cannot!"</p>

<p>"You will not give me that little promise, Bonnibel?"</p>

<p>"<i>I cannot</i>," she moaned, sinking into a chair and hiding her
face in her hands.</p>

<p>"You are determined to leave me, then, if you can?" he exclaimed
in a voice of blended horror and reproach.</p>

<p>"<i>I must</i>," she reiterated.</p>

<p>"Then tell me <i>why</i> you must go away, Bonnibel. What is this
fatal secret that is driving you forth into exile? This mystery
will drive me mad!"</p>

<p>She removed her hands a moment, and looked up at him with
sad, wistful eyes, and a face crimson with painful blushes.</p>

<p>"Colonel Carlyle, I will tell you this much," she said, "for I
see that you suspect me of that which I would rather die than be
guilty of. I am not going because a guilty passion for a former
lover is driving me from your arms to his. If I go into exile I
shall go alone, and I shall pray for death every hour until my
weary days upon earth are ended forever. Death is the only
happiness I look for, the future holds nothing for me but the
blackness of darkness. I can tell you nothing more!"</p>

<p>She ceased, and dropped her anguished face into the friendly
shelter of her hands again. He remained rooted to the spot as if
he could never move again.</p>

<p>"Bonnibel," he said, at last, "surely some subtle madness possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
you. You do not know what you would do. I must save
you from yourself until you become rational again."</p>

<p>With these words he went out of the room, locking the door
behind him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>


<p>Colonel Carlyle had not quitted the room an hour before
Bonnibel's maid, Dolores, came into her presence, bearing a
sealed letter upon a salver.</p>

<p>"<i>Une lettre</i> from monsieur le colonel, for Madam Carlyle," she
said, in her curious <i>melange</i> of French and English. Bonnibel
took the letter, and Dolores retreated to a little distance and
stood awaiting her pleasure.</p>

<p>"What can he have to write to me of?" she thought, in some
surprise, as she opened the envelope.</p>

<p>She read these words in a rather tremulous hand-writing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Bonnibel, my dear wife," and she shuddered slightly at the
words&mdash;"I sought you a little while ago to inform you of my
immediate departure for Paris, but our interview was of so harrowing
a nature that I was forced to leave you without communicating
my intention. I could not endure your reproaches longer.
I am compelled to leave you here&mdash;circumstances force my immediate
return to Paris. It is possible, nay, probable, that I may
have to make a trip to the United States before I return to Naples.
Believe me, it is distressing to me beyond measure to
leave you now under existing circumstances, but the business
that takes me away is most imperative and admits of no delay.</p>

<p>"I have made every possible provision for your comfort and
pleasure during my absence. The housekeeper, the domestics
and your own especial maid will care for you faithfully. In an
hour I leave here. If you have any commands for me; if you
are willing to see me again, and speak even one word of kind
farewell, send me a single line by Dolores, and I will be at your
side in an instant.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Clifford Carlyle.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She finished reading and dropped the letter, forgetful of the
lynx-eyed French woman who regarded her curiously. Her eyes
wandered to the window, and she fell into deep thought.</p>

<p>"Madam," the maid said, hesitatingly, "Monsieur le colonel
awaits <i>une</i> reply. He hastens to be gone."</p>

<p>Bonnibel looked up at her.</p>

<p>"Go, Dolores," she answered, coldly; "tell him there is <i>no reply</i>."</p>

<p>Dolores courtesied and went away. Bonnibel relapsed into
thought again. She was glad that Colonel Carlyle was going
away, yet she felt a faint curiosity as to the imperative business
which necessitated his return to his native land. She had never
heard him allude to business before. He had been known to her
only as a gentleman of elegant leisure.</p>

<p>"Some of the banks in which his wealth is invested have failed,
perhaps," she thought, vaguely, and dismissed the subject from
her mind without a single suspicion of the fatal truth&mdash;that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
jealous old man was going to America to be present at the trial
of Leslie Dane, and to prosecute him to the death. Ah! but too
truly is it declared in Holy Writ that "jealousy is strong as
death, and as cruel as the grave."</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle was filled with a raging hatred against the man
who had loved Bonnibel Vere before he had ever looked upon her
alluring beauty.</p>

<p>He had received an anonymous letter filled with exaggerated
descriptions of Bonnibel's love for the artist, and his wild passion
for her. The writer insinuated that the lovely girl had sold herself
for the old man's gold, believing that he would soon die, and
leave her free to wed the poor artist, and endow him with the
wealth thus obtained. Now, said the unknown writer, since the
lovers had met again their passion would fain overleap every barrier,
and they had determined to fly with each other to liberty
and love.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle was reading the letter for the hundredth time
when Dolores returned from delivering his letter to Bonnibel
with the cold message that there was "no reply."</p>

<p>That bitter refusal to the yearning cry of his heart for one kind
farewell word only inflamed him the more against the man whom
he believed held his wife's heart. It seemed to him that that in
itself was a crime for which Leslie Dane merited nothing less
than death.</p>

<p>"She read my letter?" he said to the maid who stood waiting
before him.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, Monsieur</i>," answered Dolores, with her unfailing courtesy.</p>

<p>"That is well," he said, briefly; "now, go."</p>

<p>Dolores went away and left him wrestling with the bitterest
emotions the heart of man can feel. He was old, and the conflicting
passions of the last few years had aged him in appearance
more than a score of years could have done. He looked haggard,
and worn, and weary. But his heart had not kept pace with his
years. It was still capable of feeling the bitter pangs that a
younger man might have felt in his place. Felise Herbert had
done a fearful work in making this man the victim of her malevolent
revenge. Left to himself he had the nobility of a good
and true manhood within him. But the hand of a demon had
played upon the strings of the viler passions that lay dormant
within him, and transformed him into a fiend.</p>

<p>"Not one word!" he exclaimed, to himself, in a passion of bitter
resentment. "Not one word will she vouchsafe for me in her
pride and scorn. Ah, well, Leslie Dane, you shall pay for this!
I will hound you to your death if wealth and influence can push
the prosecution forward! Not until you are in your grave can I
ever breathe freely again!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The slow, sad days that bring us all things ill" merged into
weary weeks, but brought no release to the restless young creature
who pined and chafed in her confinement like a bird that
vainly beats its wings against the gilded bars of its cage. Dolores
Dupont guarded her respectfully but rigorously. Weary days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and nights went by while she watched the sun shining by day on
the blue Bay of Naples, and the moonlight by night silvering its
limpid waves with brightness. Her sick heart wearied of the
changeless beauty, the tropical sweetness and fragrance about
her. A cold, northern sky, with darkening clouds and sunless
days, would have suited her mood better than the tropical
sweetness of Southern Italy. As it was she would sometimes
murmur to herself as she wearily paced the length of her gilded
prison:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Night, even in the zenith of her dark domain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is sunshine to the color of my fate."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But "the darkest hour is just before day," it is said. It was
as true for our sweet Bonnibel as it has proved for many another
weary soul vainly beating its weary wings against the bars of
life in the struggle to be free. Just now, when her heart and
hope had failed utterly and her only chance of escape seemed to
lie in a frank confession of the truth to Colonel Carlyle, the path
of freedom lay just before her feet, and destiny was busy shaping
an undreamed-of future for that weary, restless young heart.</p>

<p>"I can bear it no longer," she murmured, as she paced the
floor late one night, thinking over her troubles until her brain
seemed on fire. "I will write to Colonel Carlyle and tell him
the truth&mdash;tell him that dreadful secret&mdash;that I am not his wife,
that I belong to another! Surely he must let me go free then.
He will hate me that I have brought such shame upon him; but
he will keep the secret for his own sake, and let me go away and
hide myself somewhere in the great dark world until I die."</p>

<p>She dropped upon her knees and lifted her clasped hands to
heaven, while bitter tears rained over her pallid cheeks.</p>

<p>"Heaven help me!" she moaned; "it is hard, hard! If I only
had not married Colonel Carlyle all might have gone well. Oh,
Leslie, Leslie, I loved you so! God help me, I love you still!
Yet I shall never see you again, although I am your wife! Ah,
never, never, for a gulf lies between us&mdash;a gulf of sin, though
Heaven is my witness I am innocent of all intentional wrong-doing.
I would have died first!"</p>

<p>Her words died away in a moan of pain; but presently the anguished
young voice rose again:</p>

<p>"The sibyl's fateful prophecy has all been fulfilled. Yet how
little I dreamed that it <i>could</i> come true! Oh, God, how is it that
I, the proud daughter of the Veres and the Arnolds, can live
with the shadow of disgrace upon my head?"</p>

<p>She dropped her face in her hands, and the "silence of life,
more pathetic than death," filled the room. All was strangely
still; nothing was heard but the murmurous waves of the beautiful
Bay of Naples softly lapping the shore. Suddenly a slight,
strange sound echoed through the room. Bonnibel sprang to her
feet, a little startled, and listened in alarm. Again the sound
was repeated. It seemed to Bonnibel as if someone had thrown
a few pebbles against the window. Yes, it must be that, she was
sure.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>


<p>Full of vague alarm, blent with a little trembling hope of she
knew not what, Bonnibel ran to the window, which was fortunately
not fastened down, pushed up the sash and peered down
into the night. The moon had not fully risen yet, and there was
but a faint light in the clear sky, but down in the dark shrubbery
below she fancied she could see a human form and a white
face upturned to the window.</p>

<p>Yes, she was right. In a moment a low and cautious, but perfectly audible
voice, floated up to her ears.</p>

<p>"Oh! my <i>dear</i> Miss Bonnibel," was what it said, "is that you?"</p>

<p>Bonnibel put her hand to her heart as if the shock of joy were
too great to be borne.</p>

<p>It was the voice of the poor girl over whose unknown fate her
heart had ached for many weary days&mdash;the welcome voice of
faithful Lucy Moore.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is Bonnibel," she murmured gently back, fearing that
her voice might be heard by Dolores Dupont, who slept on a
couch in the dressing-room to be near her mistress.</p>

<p>"Are you alone?" inquired Lucy, softly.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite alone," was answered back.</p>

<p>"Miss Bonnibel, I have a rope-ladder down here. I am going
to throw it up to you. Try and catch it, and fasten it to your
window strongly enough for me to climb up to you."</p>

<p>Bonnibel leaned forward silently. A twisted bundle was skillfully
thrown up, and she caught it in her hands. Stepping back
into the room she uncoiled a light yet strong ladder of silken
rope.</p>

<p>"Fasten it into the hooks that are used to secure the window-shutters,"
said Lucy's voice from below.</p>

<p>Trembling with joy, Bonnibel fastened the ends strongly as
directed, and threw the rope down to Lucy. In a few moments
the girl had climbed up to the window, sprang over the sill, and
had her young mistress in her arms.</p>

<p>"One kiss, you darling!" she said, in a voice of ecstasy, "then
I must pull up the rope, for I fear discovery, and I have much
to tell you before I take you away with me!"</p>

<p>Bonnibel's heart gave a quick bound of joy.</p>

<p>"Oh! Lucy, will you really take me away?" she exclaimed,
pressing the girl's hand fondly.</p>

<p>"That's what I am here for," answered Lucy, withdrawing
her mistress into the darkest corner of the room, after having
drawn her rope up and dropped the curtains over the coil as it
lay upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Lucy, how did you ever find me?" exclaimed Bonnibel, gladly,
as they sat down together on a low divan, mutually forgetting
the difference in their position as mistress and maid in the joy of
their re-union.</p>

<p>"I've never lost track of you, Miss Bonnibel, since the night
your husband turned me into the cold, dark street."</p>

<p>"Cruel!" muttered Bonnibel, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was cruel," said Lucy, "but I didn't spend the night in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the streets! Pierre, the hall-servant, let me in again unbeknownst
to Colonel Carlyle, and I slept in my old room that
night, though I couldn't get to speak to you because he had
locked you into your room and kept the key. At daylight I went
away and secured a lodging near you&mdash;you know I had plenty of
money, Miss Bonnibel, because you were always very generous!
That evening when Colonel Carlyle took you away, along with
that hateful furrin maid, I followed after, you may be sure, and
I've been in Naples ever since trying to get speech of you; but
though I've tried bribery, and corruption, and cunning, too, I've
always failed until to-night."</p>

<p>She paused to take breath, and Bonnibel silently pressed her
hand.</p>

<p>"So there's the whole story in a nutshell," continued Lucy,
after a minute; "I ain't got time to spin it out, for you and me,
Miss Bonnibel, has to get away from here as quick as ever we can!
Do you think you can climb down my ladder of rope?"</p>

<p>Bonnibel smiled at the anxious tone of the girl's question.</p>

<p>"Of course I can, Lucy," she said, confidently, "I wish there
were nothing harder in life than that."</p>

<p>"Miss Bonnibel," said the girl, in a low voice, "we must be going
in a minute or two, now. Can you get a dark suit to put on?
And have you any money you can take with you? For it will
take more money than I have in my purse, perhaps, to carry us
home to New York."</p>

<p>"To New York&mdash;are we going back there?" faltered the listener.</p>

<p>"As fast as wind and water can carry us!" answered the girl.
"You and me are needed there in a hurry, my darling mistress.
At least <i>you</i> are, for I feel almost sure that a man's life is hanging
on your evidence."</p>

<p>"Lucy, what can you mean?" exclaimed Bonnibel, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see they have told you nothing!" answered Lucy.</p>

<p>Bonnibel caught her arm and looked anxiously into her face.</p>

<p>"No one has told me anything," she said. "What should
they have told me?"</p>

<p>"Much that you never knew, perhaps," said the girl, shaking
her head gravely.</p>

<p>"Then tell it me yourself," said Bonnibel. "Do not keep me
in suspense, my good girl."</p>

<p>"May I ask you a question first, Miss Bonnibel?"</p>

<p>"As many as you please, Lucy!"</p>

<p>"You remember the night poor old master was murdered?"
said the girl, as if reluctant to recall that painful subject.</p>

<p>"As if I could ever forget it," shuddered the listener.</p>

<p>"You were down at the shore until late that night," pursued
the girl, "and when you got back you found your uncle dead&mdash;murdered!
Miss Bonnibel, was Mr. Dane with you that night
on the sands? I have sometimes been athinkin' he might a
been."</p>

<p>"Lucy, what are you trying to get at?" gasped the listener.</p>

<p>"I only asked you the question," said Lucy, humbly.</p>

<p>"And I cannot understand why you ask it, Lucy, but I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
answer it truly. Leslie Dane was with me every moment of the
time."</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Lucy, fervently. "Thank God!"</p>

<p>"Lucy, please explain yourself," said Bonnibel anxiously.
"You frighten me with your mysterious looks and words.
What has gone wrong?"</p>

<p>"I am going to tell you as fast as I can, my dear young mistress.
Try and bear it as bravely as you can, for you must go
back to America to right a great wrong."</p>

<p>"A great wrong!" repeated the listener, helplessly.</p>

<p>"You were so sick after Mr. Arnold died," said Lucy, continuing
her story, "that the doctors kept the papers and all the
news that was afloatin' around, away from you; so it happened
that we never let you know that your friend, Mr. Leslie Dane,
was charged with the murder of your uncle."</p>

<p>There was a minute's shocked silence; then, with a smothered
moan of horror, Bonnibel slid from her place and fell on the
floor in a helpless heap at Lucy's feet.</p>

<p>"Oh! Miss Bonnibel, rouse yourself&mdash;oh, for God's sake don't
you faint! Oh, me! oh, me! what a born fool I was to tell
you that before I got you away from this place!" cried Lucy in
terror, kneeling and lifting the drooping head upon her arm.</p>

<p>"Oh! Miss Bonnibel, please don't you faint now!" she reiterated,
taking a bottle of smelling salts from her pocket and applying
it to the young lady's nostrils.</p>

<p>Thus vehemently adjured, Bonnibel opened her blue eyes and
looked up into the troubled face of her attendant.</p>

<p>"We have got to be going now," urged the girl, "you must
keep all your strength to get away from here."</p>

<p>"I will," said Bonnibel, struggling to a sitting posture in
Lucy's supporting arms. "I am quite strong, Lucy, I shall not
faint, I give you my word, I will not! Go on with your story!"</p>

<p>"I mustn't&mdash;you can't stand it," answered the girl, hesitating.</p>

<p>"Go on," Bonnibel said, with a certain little authoritative ring
in her voice that Lucy had always been wont to obey.</p>

<p>"If I must then," said Lucy, reluctantly, "but there's but little
more to tell. Mr. Dane got away and they never caught him
till the night of your grand masquerade ball when Colonel Carlyle
recognized him. The next day he had him arrested and put
in a French prison on the charge of murder."</p>

<p>"And now?" asked Bonnibel, in horror-struck accents.</p>

<p>"And they all sailed for the United States more than two
weeks ago," answered Lucy, sadly. "Mr. Dane to his trial, and
Colonel Carlyle, Mrs. Arnold and Miss Felise Herbert to testify
against him."</p>

<p>"More than two weeks ago," repeated Bonnibel like one dazed.</p>

<p>"I heard some men talking about it," Lucy went on, "and
they said that if Mr. Dane couldn't prove his absence at the time
of the murder he would certainly get hung."</p>

<p>A moan was Bonnibel's only response.</p>

<p>"So you see, my dear young mistress, that his only chance
rests on your evidence, and we must start right away if we are
to get there to save him!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Bonnibel sprang to her feet, trembling all over.</p>

<p>"Let us go this moment," she said, feverishly; "oh, what if
we should be too late!"</p>

<p>Wild with horror she set about her preparations. Her one
thought now was to save Leslie Dane though the whole world
should know the shameful secret she tried so hard to keep from
its knowledge.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>February winds blew coldly over the sea at Cape May, the day
was bleak and sunless, a misty, drizzling rain fell slowly but continuously,
chilling the very marrow of one's bones. No one who
could have helped it would have cared to venture out in such
dreary, uncomfortable, depressing weather. But up and down
the beach, before the closed mansion of Sea View, walked a
weird, strange figure, bareheaded in the pitiless war of the elements,
bowed and bent by age, clothed in rent and tattered finery,
with scant, gray locks flying elfishly in the breeze that blew
strongly and cruelly enough to have lifted the little, witch-like
form and cast it into the sea.</p>

<p>"I am a fool to come out in such stormy weather!" this odd
creature muttered to herself. "What is it that drives me out of
my sick bed to wander here in the rain and wind before Francis
Arnold's house? There is a thing they call <i>Remorse</i>, ha, ha&mdash;is
that the haunting devil that pursues me?"</p>

<p>She looked at the lonely mansion, and turned back to the sea
with a shudder.</p>

<p>"<i>Whose</i> is the sin?" she said, looking weirdly out at the wild
waves as if they had a human voice to answer her query. "<i>She</i>
tempted me with her gold&mdash;she had murder in her heart as red
as if she had dyed her hands in his life-blood! Ugh!" she wrung
her hands and shook them from her as if throwing off invisible
drops, "how thick and hot it was when it spurted out over my
hands! Yet was not the sin hers? Hers was the brain that
planned, mine but the hand that struck the blow!"</p>

<p>"Gold, gold!" she went on, after a shuddering pause, "what
a devil it is to tempt one! I never harmed human being before,
but the yellow glitter was so beautiful to my sight that it betrayed
me. Strange, that when it had made me do her will, it
should have grown hateful to my sight, and burned my hands,
till I came here and cast every golden piece of my blood-bought
treasure into the sea."</p>

<p>She drew nearer to the waves, peeping into them as if perchance
the treasure she had cast into their bosom might yet be
visible.</p>

<p>"There was a man named Judas," she muttered; "I have
heard them tell of him somewhere&mdash;he sold a man's life for some
pieces of silver&mdash;but when it was done he went and cast the
treasure back to those who had bought his soul. He must have
felt as I do. What is it that I feel&mdash;<i>remorse</i>, <i>repentance</i>, or a horror
of that dreadful leap I shall soon be taking into the dark?"</p>

<p>Walking wildly up and down she did not see two figures coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
towards her through the mist of the rain&mdash;two female
figures shrouded in long water-proof cloaks and thick veils.</p>

<p>"Miss Bonnibel," said one to the other, "'tis the wicked old
witch&mdash;the fortune-teller&mdash;Wild Madge. Sure the old thing
must be crazy, tramping out in such wild weather!"</p>

<p>Bonnibel shuddered as she looked at the weird old creature.</p>

<p>"Cannot we avoid her notice?" she inquired, shrinking from
contact with the sibyl.</p>

<p>At that moment Wild Madge turned and saw them. Directly
she came up to them with her fortune-teller's whine:</p>

<p>"Cross my palm with silver and I will tell your fortune,
bonny ladies."</p>

<p>"No, no, Wild Madge, we haven't got time to hear our fortunes
told," said Lucy Moore. "Don't try to detain us. We are
on a mission of life and death."</p>

<p>"So am I," mocked the sibyl with her strange, discordant
laugh. "Death is on my trail to-day; but I know you, Lucy
Moore, and you, too, lovely lady," she added, peering curiously
under Bonnibel's veil. "I told your fortune once, pretty one&mdash;did
the prophecy come true?" she inquired, seizing hold of Bonnibel's
reluctant hand, and drawing off her glove.</p>

<p>"Yes, it came true," she answered, tremblingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I see, I see," said the sibyl, peering into the little hand;
"you have suffered&mdash;you suffer still! But, lady, listen to me!
The clouds are breaking, there is a silver lining to every one that
droops over you now. You may believe what I tell you; ha! ha!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And coming events cast their shadows before.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Uttering the quotation with the air of a prophetess, she released
Bonnibel's hand and suddenly sank upon the wet ground
with a stifled moan of pain.</p>

<p>"Oh! Lucy, she is ill&mdash;her hands are as hot as fire, her eyes are
quite glassy," exclaimed Bonnibel in alarm as she bent over the
fallen form.</p>

<p>"We can't help that, Miss Bonnibel&mdash;we are compelled to hurry
on to Brandon," said the girl, for though ordinarily the softest-hearted
of human beings her impatience to be gone made her
rather indifferent to the visible weakness and illness of the sibyl.</p>

<p>"Oh! but, Lucy, we must spare her a moment," cried Bonnibel,
full of womanly pity, and forgetting her dread of the sibyl
at sight of her sufferings; "she must not die out here in the
cold and rain. Let us take her between us and lead her to the
house, and leave her in care of the old housekeeper if she is
there."</p>

<p>"We must hurry, then," said Lucy; "Mr. Leslie Dane's life is
worth more than this old witch's if she lived two hundred years
to follow her trade of lying!"</p>

<p>She stooped very gently, however, and helped the poor creature
to her feet; supporting the frail form between them, the mistress
and maid walked on toward the house.</p>

<p>"What threatens Leslie Dane's life?" inquired the old sibyl
suddenly, as she walked between them with drooping head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are trying him for the murder of Mr. Arnold, more
than three years ago, if you must know," said Lucy.</p>

<p>"Is he innocent?" inquired the old creature in a faltering
voice.</p>

<p>"Innocent? Of course he is&mdash;as innocent as the angels,"
answered Lucy, "but he can never prove it unless me and Miss
Bonnibel can get the witnesses at Brandon to prove an <i>alibi</i> for
him. So you see we are wasting time on you, old woman."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," faltered Wild Madge, humbly. "But where are
they trying him, Lucy Moore?"</p>

<p>"At Cape May Court House, old woman&mdash;and the evidence
will be summed up to-day, the jurors will give their verdict.
You see we must hurry, if we would save him."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; better to leave the old woman to die in the rain, and
hurry on," whined the sick woman.</p>

<p>"We are here now. We will leave you under shelter at least,"
Bonnibel answered gently.</p>

<p>They led her in, and consigned her to the care of the wondering
old housekeeper at Sea View, and went back to the shore.</p>

<p>The <i>Bonnibel</i>, battered and worn, but still seaworthy, rocked
at her moorings yet. They loosened the little craft, sprang in,
Bonnibel took up the oars, and the little namesake shot swiftly
forward through the rough waves to Brandon.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>"Prisoner at the bar, have you anything to say why the sentence
of death shall not be pronounced against you?"</p>

<p>The solemn words of the judge echo through the crowded
court-room, and the sea of human faces turn curiously and with
one accord towards the spot where the prisoner sits with his
friend, the handsome German artist, by his side, where he has
remained throughout the trial.</p>

<p>The case has excited much interest, for the murdered man had
been widely known, and as for the man accused of the murder,
his native land had but just commenced to hear of him as a son
whose brow was crowned with laurels in the world of art. But
almost simultaneously with the announcement of his brilliant
success abroad had followed the dreadful tidings of his arrest for
the murder of Mr. Arnold, and the distinguished position of the
murdered man and the fame of the gifted young artist accused
of the crime had drawn thousands to the trial.</p>

<p>It was all over now. Day after day the prisoner had sat with
his flashing dark eye, and calm, pale brow, listening to the damning
evidence against him. From first to last, despite the entreaties
of his lawyer and friends, he had resolutely declined to attempt
proving an <i>alibi</i>&mdash;the only thing that could have saved him.
Now, the trial was over, the evidence had been summed up and
given to the jury, and they had returned their verdict of willful
murder. Nothing now remained but the dreadful duty of the
judge&mdash;to pronounce upon that young, handsome, gifted man the
sentence of annihilation&mdash;of <i>death</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>And accordingly he had begun with the usual ceremonious
formula:</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say why the sentence of death should
not be pronounced against you?"</p>

<p>And the eager crowd surged forward for a nearer view of Leslie
Dane's face.</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle was there, sitting with Mrs. Arnold and Felise
Herbert. There was an ill-concealed expression of relief and
satisfaction upon the faces of the three. They had pursued an
innocent man to the death, but no twinge of remorse stirred their
hard hearts as he rose in his seat, pale, proud and handsome, towering
above the crowd in his kingly hight and stateliness, and confronted
the judge.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say, your honor, except that <i>I am not guilty</i>!"</p>

<p>A low murmur of approbation from some, and of dissent
from others instantly arose, and was immediately hushed by the
crier of the court.</p>

<p>At that moment, when the judge rose to the performance of
his duty, a messenger brought a tiny slip of paper and placed it in
the hands of Leslie Dane's lawyer. As he read it his gloomy face
brightened marvelously. He rose in his seat flushed and radiant.</p>

<p>"May it please your honor to suspend the sentence of the court.
There is a new and important witness."</p>

<p>The next moment a graceful, veiled figure, clad in heavy,
soundless black silk, glided into the witness-box.</p>

<p>She was sworn, and lifted her veil to kiss the book. A perfectly
beautiful face, blanched to the pallor of marble, was revealed
by the action. A murmur of admiration arose from the
spectators, blent with subdued exclamations of horror from
three who were nearly stricken lifeless by her unexpected advent.</p>

<p>"Silence in the court!" thundered the crier.</p>

<p>The examination of the witness began.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>And clear and sweet as a silver bell the lady's voice arose in
answer, penetrating every strained ear in the densely-packed
court-room.</p>

<p>"I have been known as Bonnibel Carlyle, but I am Bonnibel
Dane, the wife of the prisoner at the bar!"</p>

<p>As the words left her lips she glanced beneath her long lashes
at the face of Leslie Dane. In her swift look there was shame,
abnegation, self-sacrifice, curiously blended with uncontrollable
pity and almost tenderness. The face that looked back at her
was so radiant that it almost dazzled her. Her eyes dropped
swiftly, and she never looked at him again while she stood there.</p>

<p>Many eyes turned upon Colonel Carlyle to see how he bore the
stroke of fate. He sat perfectly still, white as marble, staring
like one frozen into a statue of horror at the beautiful witness
in the box, whose blue eyes took no note of his presence.</p>

<p>The examination proceeded. Bonnibel told her story calmly,
clearly, bravely. When she concluded and left the witness-stand
she was succeeded by the old minister and his wife, whom she
had brought from Brandon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>They corroborated her testimony and left no flaw in the evidence.
The clouds which had hung over Leslie Dane's fair name
so long were dissipated by the sunlight of truth. His <i>alibi</i> was
triumphantly established, his innocence perfectly vindicated.
And then, to the surprise of all and the utter consternation of
Felise Herbert, Wild Madge, the sibyl, hobbled weakly into the
witness-box, pale, wrinkled, cadaverous, the image of hideous
old age and approaching death. Breathless silence pervaded
the multitude while the dying woman told her story, interspersing
it with many expressions of remorse and horror. Briefly
told, her confession amounted to this: Felise Herbert had sought
her humble cabin the night that Mr. Arnold and Leslie Dane had
quarreled, and bribed her to murder the millionaire. Tempted by
the large reward, she had stolen upon Mr. Arnold as he slept in
his arm-chair on the piazza and stabbed him to the heart with a
large knife. Then, ere long, remorse had fastened upon her, and
she had cast the golden price of her dreadful crime into the engulfing
waves of the ocean. Finishing her story with a last
labored effort, and throwing up her arms wildly into the air,
Wild Madge, the feared and dreaded sibyl of Cape May fell forward
on the floor of the court-room&mdash;dead!</p>

<p>As soon as her body had been removed from the place the
lawyer who had prosecuted Leslie Dane rose hastily in his seat.
It might be out of order, he said, but he should be glad to ask a
few questions of the minister who had performed the marriage
ceremony between Leslie Dane and Miss Bonnibel Vere.</p>

<p>His request was granted, and the aged, white-haired preacher
was again placed on the witness-stand, while curiosity was on
the qui vive for further developments. The lawyer cross-questioned
the old man closely for a few minutes; then he turned to
the judge.</p>

<p>"I am bound, your honor," he said, "to inform those most interested
that, though the lady's evidence has completely vindicated
Leslie Dane, she has utterly failed to establish the legality
of her marriage with him. On the contrary, owing to the youth
and inexperience of the young man, perhaps partly attributable
to his haste and agitation that night, and to the culpable forgetfulness
and carelessness of the aged minister here, there was no
license procured for the authority of the marriage ceremony.
Her former marriage, therefore, has no legality in the eyes of the
law, and she still remains, as she has been known the last three
years, the wife of Colonel Carlyle."</p>

<p>As the lawyer resumed his seat, amid a breathless hum of excitement,
a loud shriek pierced the air of the court-room&mdash;a wild,
horrible, blood-curdling, maniacal cry. Every eye turned on
Felise Herbert, who had risen in her seat, and with distorted
features, livid lips and burning eyes, was wildly beating the air
with her hands. Her appearance was appalling to behold as she
stood there with her hat falling off, her hair in disorder, and
foam flecks on her livid, writhing lips.</p>

<p>"Foiled! foiled!" she exclaimed wildly. "I am baffled of my
revenge at every point."</p>

<p>Everyone seemed horror-struck. None attempted to molest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
her as she moved forward and stood before Colonel Carlyle. The
old man looked up at her vacantly. He had neither moved nor
spoken since the entrance of his wife; he seemed to be fettered
hand and foot by a trance of horror. He did not heed the
threatening look in the eyes of Felise Herbert as they fell upon
him, full of the wild glare of madness.</p>

<p>"You jilted me, fool!" she said, passionately, wildly gesticulating
with her hands&mdash;"jilted me for the sake of Bonnibel Vere's
baby beauty. I swore revenge upon you both. I forged the
notice of Leslie Dane's death, made her believe it was true, and
drove her to desperation and forced her to marry you. I made
you jealous by my anonymous letters, and turned your married
life into a hell upon earth. But now, the sweetest drop in my
cup&mdash;the illegality of your marriage&mdash;is turned into bitterness.
But I will have my revenge yet. <i>Die</i>, <i>die</i>, villain!"</p>

<p>One movement, swift as the lightning flash, and a little dagger
gleamed in her hand, and the next instant was buried to the hilt
in Colonel Carlyle's heart.</p>

<p>With a groan he fell on the floor at her feet.</p>

<p>Strong hands bore the raving maniac away, attended by her
frightened, horror-struck mother.</p>

<p>The poor victim of the madwoman's fatal revenge, as he lay
weltering in his blood, lifted his dimming eyes, and gasped one
imploring word:</p>

<p>"<i>Bonnibel!</i>"</p>

<p>Trembling like a wind-blown leaf, she came at his call, and
knelt down at his side with a great pity shining in her soft blue
eyes.</p>

<p>The dying man's gaze dwelt on her for a moment, drinking in
all the sweetness and fairness of the face he loved, and which
he was losing forever.</p>

<p>"My wife," he murmured, in hollow, broken accents, "do you
not&mdash;see&mdash;I&mdash;was&mdash;not wholly&mdash;to blame? A&mdash;fiend's&mdash;work&mdash;goaded
me&mdash;on! She has&mdash;had&mdash;her revenge. But&mdash;it&mdash;might
have been&mdash;so different&mdash;if I had known. Bonnibel, <i>forgive</i>!"</p>

<p>She took his hand in hers and bent her face lower over him,
with all the divine pity and forgiveness of a tender woman shining
in the eyes that were brimming over with tears.</p>

<p>"I am sorry it all fell out so," she said, very gently, "and I
forgive all&mdash;as freely as I hope to be forgiven."</p>

<p>A beam of love and gratitude flashed over his features an instant;
then it faded out in the grayness and pallor of death.
Bonnibel turned away, and hid her face on the shoulder of the
faithful Lucy.</p>

<p>"It's all over, my poor darling. Shall we go away now?" Lucy
whispered.</p>

<p>"We must go back to his home with him, Lucy. We must
show him the last tribute of respect. I have forgiven him. He
was more sinned against than sinning," she murmured back.</p>

<p>So when the mournful funeral cortege moved from the gates
of his stately home, Colonel Carlyle's darling, whom he had so
passionately loved despite his jealous madness, went down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
portals of the grave with him, and saw all that was mortal of
Clifford Carlyle laid away in the kindred dust.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h2>


<p>Felise Herbert was pronounced by the most competent physicians
a dangerous and incurable maniac. She was accordingly
removed to an insane asylum for life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold escaped all suspicion of complicity in her daughter's
crimes, and was suffered to go free from the terrors of the
law. But she had no object in life now. The destruction of her
idol had torn down the fair citadel of hope and plunged her into
incurable despair. Wealth and position were nothing to her
now, since the beautiful girl for whose sake she had schemed to
secure them could never enjoy them. Among Felise's effects she
found Mr. Arnold's stolen will. In a spasm of remorse, she restored
it to the owner, and Bonnibel received her share of the
large fortune her Uncle Francis had bequeathed her. Mrs. Arnold
went into the insane asylum where her daughter was confined,
and became a nurse there for the sake of being near the
wretched and violent maniac.</p>

<p>And Bonnibel?</p>

<p>Colonel Carlyle had bequeathed her the whole of his large fortune,
which, added to her inheritance from her uncle, made her
one of the wealthiest women in New York. But wealth cannot buy
happiness. Mrs. Carlyle, young, beautiful and wealthy though she
was, might yet have exclaimed with the gifted poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If happiness have not her seat and center in the breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We may be wise, or rich, or great; we never can be blest."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She shut up the splendid New York mansion, and, taking Lucy
with her, went back to Sea View, the home she had always loved
best. There, lulled by the ocean waves, and nursed by the tender
breezes, she hoped to find a measure of rest and contentment.</p>

<p>"Lucy, there can be no more talk of mistress and maid between
you and me," she said then. "You have proved yourself a true and
faithful friend. I shall settle ten thousand dollars upon you, and
you shall stay, if you will, as my companion."</p>

<p>But Lucy Moore proved obstinate.</p>

<p>"I haven't got education enough to be your companion," she answered;
"I would rather be your maid still. I love to be about
you, and tend you, and care for you."</p>

<p>Bonnibel settled the sum she had named upon her, but the devoted
girl still remained with her in her old position. Summer
came with birds and flowers, and gentle breezes, then waned and
faded, as do all things beautiful, and autumn winds blew coldly
over the sea.</p>

<p>One cool yet sunny afternoon the lovely widow went down to
the shore for her accustomed row in her pretty namesake, the
<i>Bonnibel</i>, which had been newly repaired and trimmed.</p>

<p>To her surprise, the little bark was not there, rocking idly
about at its own sweet will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who can have borrowed it?" she wondered, sitting down on
the sands to watch for its return.</p>

<p>But after awhile her hands dropped into her lap and clasped
each other loosely; she fell into a fit of musing, and forgot to
watch the sea for return of her truant bark. There was a vague
doubt and trouble tugging at her heart-strings as she recalled
some lines she had loved long ago:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And yet I know past all doubting, truly,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A knowledge greater than grief can dim&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I know as he loved, he will love me duly,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Yea, better, even better than I love him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And as I walk by the vast calm river,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The awful river so dread to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I say, 'Thy breadth and thy depth forever<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Are bridged by his thoughts that cross to me.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The keel of the <i>Bonnibel</i> grated suddenly on the shore; the
boatman sprang out by her side.</p>

<p>She looked up into the dark eyes of Leslie Dane.</p>

<p>"No, do not rise," he said, kneeling down beside her as she
made a nervous movement, "I do not wish to startle you."</p>

<p>He held out his hand and she laid hers silently within it for a
moment.</p>

<p>"I have been traveling all over my native land with my friend,
Mr. Muller," he said, "and we talk of returning to Europe soon;
but I could not go, Bonnibel, till I came down here to thank you
for&mdash;that day when you saved my life at such a sacrifice."</p>

<p>"It is a canceled debt," she answered, quietly. "Do not forget
that you were about to give your life to save my secret."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. She was looking out at the
ocean with troubled, blue eyes, and a faint quiver on the tender
lips. He was looking at her as he looked long ago with his heart
in his eyes. Suddenly he caught both hands in his and held them
tightly.</p>

<p>"It was a dreadful mistake I made that night when I thought
I had bound you so truly my own," he said. "Bonnibel, I
wonder whether you are glad or sorry now that it happened so?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was for the best," she answered, gently, "the way
things fell out."</p>

<p>A shade of disappointment crossed his handsome features.</p>

<p>"Then, Bonnibel, my darling, loved through it all," he cried,
"you would not be willing to give yourself to me now?"</p>

<p>She smiled and lifted her eyes to his. In their blue and tender
depths he saw shining on him the unchangeable love of a lifetime.</p>

<p>"Make the bond a tighter one, next time, Leslie," she said,
with a shy and radiant smile.</p>

<p>He stooped and clasped her fondly in his arms.</p>

<p>"Ah, darling," he answered, holding her tightly clasped to his
wildly beating heart, "there shall be no blind, boyish mistake this
time. There shall be a license that shall hold you mine as fast
and tight <i>forever</i> as I hold you now in my arms!"</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
